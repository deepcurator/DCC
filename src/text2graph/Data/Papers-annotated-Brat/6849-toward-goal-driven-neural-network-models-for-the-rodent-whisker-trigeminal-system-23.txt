for example, in the whisker trigeminal system, information from the whiskers is relayed from primary sensory neurons in the trigeminal ganglion to multiple trigeminal nuclei; these nuclei are the origin of several parallel pathways conveying information to the thalamus [36, 24] and then to primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (s1 and s2) [4] .
