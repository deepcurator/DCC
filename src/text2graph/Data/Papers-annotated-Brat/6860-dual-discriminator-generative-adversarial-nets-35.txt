we materialize our idea using gan's framework, resulting in a novel generative adversarial architecture containing three players: a discriminator d 1 that rewards high scores for data sampled from p data rather than generated from the generator distribution p g whilst another discriminator d 2 , conversely, favoring data from p g rather p data , and a generator g that generates data to fool both two discriminators.
