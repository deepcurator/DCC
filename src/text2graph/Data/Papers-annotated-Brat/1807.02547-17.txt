the architectures presented here fall within the framework of steerable g-cnns [8, 10, 41, 46] , which represent their input as fields over a homogeneous space (r 3 in this case), and use steerable the most closely related works achieving full se(3) equivariance are the tensor field network (tfn) [41] and the n-body networks (nbns) [27] .
