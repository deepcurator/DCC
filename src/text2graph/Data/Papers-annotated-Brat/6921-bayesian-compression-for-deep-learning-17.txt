from a bayesian perspective network pruning and reducing bit precision for the weights is aligned with achieving high accuracy, because bayesian methods search for the optimal model structure (which leads to pruning with sparsity inducing priors), and reward uncertain posteriors over parameters through the bits back argument [27] (which leads to removing insignificant bits).
