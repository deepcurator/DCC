introduction convolutional neural networks (cnns) [17] have enjoyed immense success as a key tool for enabling effective deep learning in a broad array of applications, like modeling natural images [36, 16] , images of human faces [15] , audio [33] , and enabling agents to play games in domains with synthetic imagery like atari [21] .
