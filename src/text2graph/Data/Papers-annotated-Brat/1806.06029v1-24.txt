this way, the autoencoder of b is adjusted by x through the loss incurred on unshared layers for domain b by the circularity loss, and through subsequent adaptation of the shared layers to fit the samples of b. this allows the shared layers to gradually adapt to the new sample x, but prevents overfitting on this single sample.
