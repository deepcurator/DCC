two example sequences of incremental image tfs applied to cifar-10 images (left); a conditional word-swap tf using an externally trained language model and specifically targeting nouns (nn) between entity mentions (e1,e2) for a relation extraction task (middle); and an unsupervised segementation-based translation tf applied to mass-containing mammography images (right).
