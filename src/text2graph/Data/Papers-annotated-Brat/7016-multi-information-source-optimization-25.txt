we demonstrate in experiments that our approach improves over the method of lam et al [18] , and we believe this improvement results from two factors: first, their statistical approach assumes an independent prior on each is, despite their being linked through modeling a common objective; and second their acquisition function selects the point to sample and the is to query separately via a heuristic rather than jointly using an optimality analysis.
