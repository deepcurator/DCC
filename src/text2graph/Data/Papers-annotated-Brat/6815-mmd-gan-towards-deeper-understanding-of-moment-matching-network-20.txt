computationally, it also requires larger batch size than gan needs for training, which is considered to be less efficient [9, 10, 14, 8] in this work, we try to improve gmmn and consider using mmd with adversarially learned kernels instead of fixed gaussian kernels to have better hypothesis testing power.
