in some cases this is easy: when inputs and outputs are naturally represented as fixed sized tensors (e.g., images of a fixed size such those in the mnist and cifar datasets, or regression problems on fixed sized vector inputs), and the computations required to process each instance are instance-invariant and expressible as standard operations on tensors (e.g., a series of matrix multiplications, convolutions, and elementwise nonlinearities), a suitably flexible tensor library rnn rnn rnn rnn rnn rnn rnn rnn rnn l rnn rnn rnn rnn l l (1) l (2) l ( y (2) y (3) x ( two computation graphs for computing the loss on a minibatch of three training instances consisting of a sequence of input vectors paired with a fixed sized output vector.
