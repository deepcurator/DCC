one of the pillars of the modern gaussian process probabilistic modelling approach is a set of sparse approximation schemes that allow the prohibitive computational cost of gp methods, typically o(n 3 ) for training and o(n 2 ) for prediction where n is the number of training points, to be substantially reduced whilst still retaining accuracy.
