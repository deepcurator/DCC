recent years have demonstrated interesting examples in a broad selection of the natural sciences, ranging from physics (aurisano et al, 2016; mills et al, 2017) to biology (wang et al, 2016; min et al, 2017) , in many cases showing convolutional neural networks to substantially outperform existing methods.
