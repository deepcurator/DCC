suppose the unordered set of the c dimensional input features are the same f = { f a , f b , f c , f d } in all the cases in figure 1 , and we have one convolution kernel k = [k α , k β , k γ , k δ ] t in shape 4 × c. in (i), by following canonical order given by the regular grid structure, the features in the local 2 × 2 patch can be casted into (ii, iii, and iv) .
