we then apply the rmc to a suite of tasks that may profit from more explicit memory-memory interactions, and hence, a potentially increased capacity for relational reasoning across time: partially observed reinforcement learning tasks, program evaluation, and language modeling on the wikitext-103, project gutenberg, and gigaword datasets.
