for example, performing elementwise operations takes nearly the same amount of time on the gpu whether operating on tens or on thousands of elements, and multiplying a few hundred different vectors by the same matrix is significantly slower than executing a single (equivalent) matrix-matrix product using an optimized gemm implementation on either a gpu or a cpu.
