in the second phase, the variational autoencoder is cloned to create two copies that share the top layers of the encoders and the bottom layers of the decoders, one for the samples in b and one for the sample x in a. the autoencoders are trained with reconstruction losses as well as with a single-sample one-way circularity-loss.
