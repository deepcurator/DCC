ihw has several limitations: first, binning the data into g groups can be difficult if the feature space x is multi-dimensional; second, the decision rule, restricted to be a constant for each group, is artificial for continuous features; and third, the asymptotic fdr control guarantee requires the number of groups going to infinity, which can be unrealistic.
