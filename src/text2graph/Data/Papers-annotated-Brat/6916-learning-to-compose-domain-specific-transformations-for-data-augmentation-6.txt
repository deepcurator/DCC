in our experiments, we show the efficacy of our approach on both image and text datasets, achieving improvements of 4.0 accuracy points on cifar-10, 1.4 f1 points on the ace relation extraction task, and 3.4 accuracy points when using domain-specific transformation operations on a medical imaging dataset as compared to standard heuristic augmentation approaches.
