a part of the generator's training involves as a subroutine a supervised adversary -hence, the saddle point formulation -called discriminator, which tries to guess whether randomly generated observations come from p or q. ideally, at the end of this supervised game, we want q to be close to p, and a good measure of this is the f -divergence i f (p q), also known as ali-silvey distance [1, 12] .
