experiments show that our algorithm compares favorably to manually batched code, that significant speed improvements are possible on architectures with no straightforward manual batching design, and that we obtain better performance than tensorflow fold [19] , an alternative framework built to simulate dynamic graph definition and automatic batching on top of tensorflow ( ยง4).
