despite such success, having redundant and highly correlated neurons (e.g., weights of kernels/filters in convolutional neural networks (cnns)) caused by over-parametrization presents an issue [35, 39] , which motivated a series of influential works in network compression [9, 1] and parameter-efficient network architectures [15, 17, 60] .
