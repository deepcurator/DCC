neural code comprehension is evaluated on multiple levels, using clustering and analogies for inst2vec, as well as three different code comprehension tasks for xfgs: algorithm classification; heterogeneous compute device (e.g., cpu, gpu) mapping; and optimal thread coarsening factor prediction, which model the runtime of an application without running it.
