in short, our main contributions are: (i) a novel generative adversarial model that encourages the diversity of samples produced by the generator; (ii) a theoretical analysis to prove that our objective is optimized towards minimizing both kl and reverse kl divergence and has a global optimum where p g = p data ; and (iii) a comprehensive evaluation on the effectiveness of our proposed method using a wide range of quantitative criteria on large-scale datasets.
