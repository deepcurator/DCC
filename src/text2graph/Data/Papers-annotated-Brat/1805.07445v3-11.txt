these powerful multivariate binary distributions can represent any distribution defined on a set of binary random variables [12] , and have seen application in unsupervised learning [13] , supervised learning [14, 15] , reinforcement learning [16] , dimensionality reduction [17] , and collaborative filtering [18] .
