to allow data distributions that have different support to that of the source p 0 , we use wasserstein distances as our metric d. our distance will be defined on the semantic space 3 , so that target populations p satisfying d(p, p 0 ) ≤ ρ will be realistic covariate shifts that preserve the same semantic representation of the source (e.g., adding color to a greyscale image).
