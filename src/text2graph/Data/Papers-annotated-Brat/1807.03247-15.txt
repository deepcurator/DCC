detection models like faster r-cnn [27] make use of layers to compute coordinate transforms and focus attention, spatial transformer networks [13] make use of differentiable cameras to transform data from the output of one cnn into a form more amenable to processing with another,  and some generative models like draw [8] iteratively perceive, focus, and refine a canvas rather than using a single pass through a cnn to generate an image.
