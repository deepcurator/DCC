to infer the neural population activity from the raw imaging data, an analysis pipeline is employed which typically involves solving the following problems (all of which are still areas of active research): i) correcting for motion artifacts during the imaging experiment, ii) identifying/extracting the sources (neurons and axonal or dendritic processes) in the imaged field of view (fov), and iii) denoising and deconvolving the neural activity from the dynamics of the expressed calcium indicator.
