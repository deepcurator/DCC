despite the recent rapid progress, these existing works often trade off between generalization, quality and efficiency, which means that optimization-based methods can handle arbitrary styles with pleasing visual quality but at the expense of high computational costs, while feed-forward approaches can be executed efficiently but are limited to a fixed number of styles or compromised visual quality.
