given a reference distribution p and a learned distribution q, precision intuitively measures the quality of the samples in q, while recall measures the proportion of p that is covered by q. furthermore, we propose an elegant algorithm which can compute these quantities based on samples from p and q. in particular, using this approach we are able to quantify the degree of mode dropping and mode inventing based on samples from the true and the learned distribution.
