the main contribution of this paper is to bridge the gap between hyperbolic and euclidean geometry in the context of neural networks and deep learning by generalizing in a principled manner both the basic operations as well as multinomial logistic regression (mlr), feed-forward (ffnn), simple and gated (gru) recurrent neural networks (rnn) to the poincar√© model of the hyperbolic geometry.
