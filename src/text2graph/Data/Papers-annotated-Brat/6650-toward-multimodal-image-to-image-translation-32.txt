in this work, we instantiate this idea by exploring several objective functions, inspired by literature in unconditional generative modeling: â€¢ cvae-gan (conditional variational autoencoder gan): one approach is first encoding the ground truth image into the latent space, giving the generator a noisy "peek" into the desired output.
