our contributions: (1) we introduce a novel definition of precision and recall for distributions and prove that the notion is theoretically sound and has desirable properties, (2) we propose an efficient algorithm to compute these quantities, (3) we relate these notions to total variation, is and fid, (4) we demonstrate that in practice one can quantify the degree of mode dropping and mode inventing on real world data sets (image and text data), and (5) we compare several types of generative models based on the proposed approach -to our knowledge, this is the first metric that experimentally confirms the folklore that gans often produce "sharper" images, but can suffer from mode collapse (high precision, low recall), while vaes produce "blurry" images, but cover the whole distribution (low precision, high recall).
