using these benchmarks, we show that our approach is able to effectively generate representations for unseen nodes and outperform relevant baselines by a significant margin: across domains, our supervised approach improves classification f1-scores by an average of 51% compared to using node features alone and graphsage consistently outperforms a strong, transductive baseline [28] , despite this baseline taking ∼100× longer to run on unseen nodes.
