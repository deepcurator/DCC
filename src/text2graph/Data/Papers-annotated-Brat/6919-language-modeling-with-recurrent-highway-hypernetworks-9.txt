greff et al and britz et al conducted exhaustive (for all practical purposes) architecture searches over simple lstm variants and demonstrated that none achieved significant improvement [4] [5]-in particular, the latter work discovered that lstms consistently outperform comparable grus on machine translation, and no proposed cell architecture to date has been proven significantly better than the lstm.
