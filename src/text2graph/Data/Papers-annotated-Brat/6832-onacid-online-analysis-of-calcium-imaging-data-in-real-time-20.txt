monitoring the activity of a roi, which usually corresponds to a soma, typically entails averaging the fluorescence over the corresponding roi, resulting in a signal that is only a proxy for the actual neural activity and which can be sensitive to motion artifacts and drifts, as well as spatially overlapping sources, background/neuropil contamination, and noise.
