in that sense, our proposed approach may be viewed as an instance of 'knowledge transfer' [17, 5] from d to g. we employ a metric-learning loss function and a self-attention answer encoding mechanism for d that makes it particularly conducive to this knowledge transfer by encouraging perceptually meaningful similarities to emerge.
