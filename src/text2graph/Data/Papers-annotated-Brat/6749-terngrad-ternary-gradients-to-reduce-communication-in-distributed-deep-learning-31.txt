comparing with previous works, our major contributions include: (1) we use ternary values for gradients to reduce communication; (2) we mathematically prove the convergence of terngrad in general by proposing a statistical bound on gradients; (3) we propose layer-wise ternarizing and gradient clipping to move this bound closer toward the bound of standard sgd.
