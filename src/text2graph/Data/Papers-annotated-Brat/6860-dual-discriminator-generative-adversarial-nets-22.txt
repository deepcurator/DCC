different from most generative models that maximize data likelihood or its lower bound, gan takes a radical approach that simulates a game between two players: a generator g that generates data by mapping samples from a noise space to the input space; and a discriminator d that acts as a classifier to distinguish real samples of a dataset from fake samples produced by the generator g. both g and d are parameterized via neural networks, thus this method can be categorized into the family of deep generative models or generative neural models [9] .
