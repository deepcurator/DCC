for early visual processing stages like the retina or primary visual cortex, several nonlinear methods have been proposed, including energy models [7, 8] , spike-triggered covariance methods [9, 10] , linear-nonlinear (ln-ln) cascades [11, 12] , convolutional subunit models [13, 14] and glms based on handcrafted nonlinear feature spaces [15] .
