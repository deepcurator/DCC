this is ultimately rooted in solomonoff's general theory of inference (solomonoff, 1964) (see also, e.g., (hutter, 2007; schmidhuber, 1997) ), whose principle is to favor models that correspond to the "shortest program" to produce the training data, based on its kolmogorov complexity (li and vit√°nyi, 2008) .
