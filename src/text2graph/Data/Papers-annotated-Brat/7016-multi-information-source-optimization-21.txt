we demonstrate in experiments that our approach improves over the method of swersky et al [34] , and we believe this improvement results from two factors: first, our statistical model is more flexible in its ability to model bias that varies across the domain; second, our acquisition function directly and maximally reduces simple regret in one step, unlike predictive entropy search which maximally reduces the maximizer's entropy in one step and hence only indirectly reduces regret.
