abstract in unsupervised domain mapping, the learner is given two unmatched datasets a and b. the goal is to learn a mapping g ab that translates a sample in a to the analog sample in b. recent approaches have shown that when learning simultaneously both g ab and the inverse mapping g ba , convincing mappings are obtained.
