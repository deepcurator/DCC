popular approaches reshape the data movies into a large array with dimensions (#pixels) Ã— (#timesteps), that is then factorized (e.g., via independent component analysis [20] or constrained non-negative matrix factorization (cnmf) [26] ) to produce the locations in the fov and temporal activities of the imaged sources.
