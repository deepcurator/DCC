formally, given a sequence of images x 1:t ∈ r h×w ×c , where the superscript denotes height, width and the number of channels of the image, respectively, and an initial location for the tracked object given by a bounding box b 1 ∈ r 4 , the conditional probability distribution factorises as p(b 2:t | x 1:t , b 1 ) = p(h 1 | x 1 , b 1 ) t t=2 p(b t | h t )p(h t | x t , b t−1 , h t−1 ) dh t dh 1 , (1) where we assume that motion of an object can be described by a markovian state h t .
