computationally, this generation step requires solving the task we term one-shot unsupervised cross domain translation: given a single sample x from an unknown domain a and many samples or, almost equivalently, a model of domain b, generate a sample y âˆˆ b that is analogous to x. while there has been a great deal of research dedicated to unsupervised domain translation, where many samples from domain a are provided, the literature does not deal, as far as we know, with the one-shot case.
