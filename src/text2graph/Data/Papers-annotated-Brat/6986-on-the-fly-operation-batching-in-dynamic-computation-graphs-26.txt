the user should only be responsible for specifying a large enough computation so that batching is possible (i.e, summing the losses of several instances, such as one sees in the left side of figure 1 ), and the framework should take care of the lower-level details of operation batching, much like optimizing compilers or jit optimizers in interpreted languages do.
