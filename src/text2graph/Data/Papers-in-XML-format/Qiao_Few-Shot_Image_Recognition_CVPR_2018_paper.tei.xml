<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Recent years have witnessed rapid advances in deep learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, with a particular example being visual recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> on large-scale image datasets, e.g., ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. Despite their great performances on benchmark datasets, the machines exhibit clear difference with people in the way they learn concepts. Deep learning methods typically require huge amounts of supervised training data per concept, and the learning process could take days using specialized hardware, i.e. GPUs. In contrast, children are known to be able to learn novel visual concepts almost effortlessly with a few examples after they have accumulated enough past knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>. This phenomenon motivates computer vision research on the problem of few-shot learning, i.e., the task to learn novel concepts from only a few examples for each category <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</p><p>Formally, in the few-shot learning problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>, we are provided with a large-scale set D large with categories C large and a few-shot set D few with categories C few that do not overlap with C large . D large has sufficient training samples for each category whereas D few has only a few examples (&lt; 6 in this paper). The goal is to achieve good classification performances, either on D few or on both D few and D large . We argue that a good classifier should have the following properties: (1) It achieves reasonable performance on C few . <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> Adapting to C few does not degrade the performance on C large significantly (if any). <ref type="bibr">(</ref>3) It is fast in inference and adapts to few-shot categories with little or zero training, i.e., an efficient lifelong learning system <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</p><p>Both parametric and non-parametric methods have been proposed for the few-shot learning problem. However, due to the limited number of samples in D few and the imbalance between D large and D few , parametric models usually fail to learn well from the training samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. On the other hand, many non-parametric approaches such as nearest neighbors can adapt to the novel concepts easily without severely forgetting the original classes. But this requires careful designs of the distance metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which can be difficult and sometimes empirical. To remedy this, some previous work instead adapts feature representation to the metrics by using siamese networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. As we will show later through experiments, these methods do not fully satisfy the properties mentioned above. In this paper, we present an approach that meets the desired properties well. Our method starts with a pre-trained deep neural network on D large . The final classification layers Figure 2: Our motivation: t-SNE <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> results on the average activationsā y of each category before the fully connected layer of a 50-layer ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> pre-trained on D large from ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> (left) and the parameters w y of each category in the last fully connected layer (right). Each point represents a category. Highlighted points with the same color and shape correspond to the same category. Circles are mammals, triangles are birds, diamonds are buses, and squares are home appliances.</p><p>(the fully connected layer and the softmax layer) are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. We use w y ∈ R n to denote the parameters for category y in the fully connected layer, and use a(x) ∈ R n to denote the activations before the fully connected layer of an image x. Training on D large is standard; the real challenge is how to re-parameterize the last fully connected layer to include the novel categories under the few-shot constraints, i.e., for each category in C few we have only a few examples. Our proposed method addresses this challenge by directly predicting the parameters w y (in the fully connected layer) using the activations belonging to that category, i.e. A y = {a(x)|x ∈ D large ∪ D few , Y (x) = y}, where Y (·) denotes the category of the image.</p><p>This parameter predictor stems from the tight relationship between the parameters and activations. Intuitively in the last fully connected layer, we want w y · a y to be large, for all a y ∈ A y . Letā y ∈ R n be the mean of the activations in A y . Since it is known that the activations of images in the same category are spatially clustered together <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, a reasonable choice of w y is to align withā y in order to maximize the inner product, and this argument holds true for all y. To verify this intuition, we use t-SNE <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> to visualize the neighbor embeddings of the activation statisticā y and the parameters w y for each category of a pre-trained deep neural network, as shown in <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Comparing them and we observe a high similarity in both the local and the global structures. More importantly, the semantic structures <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> are also preserved in both activations and parameters, indicating a promising generalizability to unseen categories.</p><p>These results suggest the existence of a categoryagnostic mapping from the activations to the parameters given a good feature extractor a(·). In our work, we parameterize this mapping with a feedforward network that is learned by back-propagation. This mapping, once learned, is used to predict parameters for both C few and C large .</p><p>We evaluate our method on two datasets. The first one is MiniImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, a simplified subset of ImageNet ILSVRC 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, in which C large has 80 categories and C few has 20 categories. Each category has 600 images of size 84 × 84. This small dataset is the benchmark for natural images that the previous few-shot learning methods are evaluated on. However, this benchmark only reports the performances on D few , and the accuracy is evaluated under 5-way test, i.e., to predict the correct category from only 5 category candidates. In this paper, we will take a step forward by evaluating our method on the full ILSVRC 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, which has 1000 categories. We split the categories into two sets where C large has 900 and C few has the rest 100. The methods will be evaluated under 1000-way test on both D large and D few . This is a setting that is considerably larger than what has been experimented in the few-shot learning before. We compare our method with the previous work and show state-of-the-art performances.</p><p>The rest of the paper is organized as follows: §2 defines and explains our model, §3 presents the related work, §4 shows the experimental results, and §5 concludes the paper.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Model</head><p>The key component of our approach is the categoryagnostic parameter predictor φ :ā y → w y <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Figure 3</ref>). More generally, we could allow the input to φ to be a statistic representing the activations of category y. Note that we use the same mapping function for all categories y ∈ C large , because we believe the activations and the parameters have similar local and global structure in their respective space. Once this mapping has been learned on D large , because of this structure-preserving property, we expect it to generalize to categories in C few . </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Learning Parameter Predictor</head><p>Since our final goal is to do classification, we learn φ from the classification supervision. Specifically, we can learn φ from D large by minimizing the classification loss (with a regularizer ||φ||) defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">L(φ) = (y,x)∈D large   −φ (āy) a(x) + log y ′ ∈C large e φ ā y ′ a(x)    + λ||φ||<label>(1)</label></formula><p>Eq. 1 models the parameter prediction for categories y ∈ C large . However, for the few-shot set C few , each category only has a few activations, whose mean value is the activation itself when each category has only one sample. To model this few-shot setting in the large-scale training on D large , we allow both the individual activations and the mean activation to represent a category. Concretely, let s y ∈ A y ∪ā y be a statistic for category y. Let S large denote a statistic set {s 1 , ..., s |Clarge| } with one for each category in C large . We sample activations s y for each category y from A y ∪ā y with a probability p mean to useā y and 1 − p mean to sample uniformly from A y . Now, we learn φ to minimize the loss defined by</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">L(φ) = (y,x)∈D large E S large   −φ (sy) a(x) + log y ′ ∈C large e φ s y ′ a(x)    + λ||φ|| (2)</formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">Inference</head><p>During inference we include C few , which calls for a statistic set for all categories S = {s 1 , ..., s |C| }, where C = C large ∪ C few . Each statistic set S can generate a set of parameters {φ(s 1 ), ..., φ(s |C| )} that can be used for building a classifier on C. Since we have more than one possible set S from the dataset D = D large ∪ D few , we can do classification based on all the possible S. Formally, we compute the probability of x being in category y by</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">P (y|x) = e ES [φ(sy)a(x)] /   y ′ ∈C e ES φ(s y ′ )a(x)  <label>(3)</label></formula><p>However, classifying images with the above equation is time-consuming since it computes the expectations over the entire space of S which is exponentially large. We show in the following that if we assume φ to be a linear mapping, then this expectation can be computed efficiently.</p><p>In the linear case φ is a matrix Φ. The predicted parameter for category y isŵ</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">y = Φ · sy (4)</formula><p>The inner product of x before the softmax function for category y is</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">h(sy, a(x)) =ŵy · a(x) = Φ · sy · a(x)<label>(5)</label></formula><p>If a(x) and s y are normalized, then by setting Φ as the identity matrix, h(s y , a(x)) is equivalent to the cosine similarity between s y and a(x). Essentially, by learning Φ, we are learning a more general similarity metric on the activations a(x) by capturing correlations between different dimensions of the activations. We will show more comparisons between the learned Φ and identity matrix in §4.1.</p><p>Because of the linearity of φ, the probability of x being in category y simplifies to</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">P (y|x) = e a(x)·φ(E S [sy]) /   y ′ ∈C e a(x)·φ(E S s y ′ )   = e a(x)·Φ·E S [sy ] /   y ′ ∈C e a(x)·Φ·E S s y ′  <label>(6)</label></formula><p>Now E S [s y ] can be pre-computed which is efficient. Adapting to novel categories only requires updating the corresponding E S [s y ]. Although it is ideal to keep the linearity of φ to reduce the amount of computation, introducing nonlinearity could potentially improve the performance. To keep the efficiency, we still push in the expectation and approximate Eq. 3 as in Eq. 6. When adding categories y ∈ C few , the estimate of E S [s y ] may not be reliable since the number of samples is small. Besides, Eq. 2 models the sampling from one-shot and mean activations. Therefore, we take a mixed strategy for parameter prediction, i.e., we use ES[sy] to predict parameters for category y ∈ C large , but for C few we treat each sample as a newly added category, as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4a</ref>. For each novel category in C few , we compute the maximal response of the activation of the test image to the parameter set predicted from each activation in the statistic set of the corresponding novel category in C few . We use them as the inputs to the SoftMax layer to compute the probabilities.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3.">Training Strategy</head><p>The objective of training is to find φ that minimizes Eq. 2. There are many methods to do this. We approach this by using stochastic gradient decent with weight decay and momentum. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4b</ref> demonstrates the training strategy of the parameter predictor φ. We train φ on D large with categories C large . For each batch of the training data, we sample |C large | statistics s y from A y ∪ā y to build a statistic set S with one for each category y in C large . Next, we sample a training activation set T from D large with one for each category in C large . In total, we sample 2|C large | activations. The activations in the statistic sets are fed to φ to generate parameters for the fully connected layer. With the predicted parameters for each category in C large , the training activation set then is used to evaluate their effectiveness by classifying the training activations. At last, we compute the classification loss with respect to the ground truth, based on which we calculate the gradients and back-propagate them in the path shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 4b</ref>. After the gradient flow passes through φ, we update φ according to the gradients.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.4.">Implementation Details</head><p>Full ImageNet Dataset Our major experiments are conducted on ILSVRC 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. ILSVRC 2015 is a largescale image dataset with 1000 categories, each of which has about 1300 images for training, and 50 images for validation. For the purpose of studying both the large-scale and the few-shot settings at the same time, ILSVRC 2015 is split to two sets by the categories. The training data from 900 categories are collected into D large , while the rest 100 categories are gathered as set D few .</p><p>We first train a 50-layer ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> on D large . We use the outputs of the global average pooling layer as the activation a(x) of an image x. For efficiency, we compute the activation a(x) for each image x before the experiments as well as the mean activationsā y . Following the training strategy shown in §2.3, for each batch, we sample 900 activations as the statistic set and 900 activations as the training activation set. We compute the parameters using the statistic set, and copy the parameters into the fully connected layer. Then, we feed the training activations into the fully connected layer, calculate the loss and back-propagate the gradients. Next, we redirect the gradient flow into φ. Finally, we update φ using stochastic gradient descent. The learning rate is set to 0.001. The weight decay is set to 0.0005 and the momentum is set to 0.9. We train φ on D large for 300 epochs, each of which has 250 batches. p mean is set to 0.9.</p><p>For the parameter predictor, we implement three different φ: φ 1 , φ 2 and φ 2 * . φ 1 is a one-layer fully connected model. φ 2 is defined as a sequential network with two fully connected layers in which each maps from 2048 dimensional features to 2048 dimensional features and the first one is followed by a ReLU non-linearity layer <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. The final outputs are normalized to unity in order to speed up training and ensure generalizability. By introducing nonlinearity, we observe slight improvements on the accuracies for both C large and C few . To demonstrate the effect of minimizing Eq. 2 instead of Eq. 1, we train another φ 2 * which has the same architecture with φ 2 but minimizes Eq. 1. As we will show later through experiments, φ 2 * has strong bias towards C large .</p><p>MiniImageNet Dataset For comparison purposes, we also test our method on MiniImageNet dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, a simplified subset of ILSVRC 2015. This dataset has 80 categories for D large and 20 categories for D few . Each category has 600 images. Each image is of size 84 × 84. For the fairness of comparisons, we train two convolutional neural networks to get the activation functions a(·). The first one is the same as that of Matching Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, and the second one is a wide residual network <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. We train the wide residual network WRN-28-10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> on D large , following its configuration for CIFAR-100 dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. There are some minor modifications to the network architecture as the input size is different. To follow the architecture, the input size is set to 80×80. The images will be rescaled to this size before training and evaluation. There will be 3 times of downsampling rather than 2 times as for CIFAR dataset. The training process follows WRN-28-10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. We also use the output of the global average pooling layer as the activation a(x) of an image x. For the parameter predictor φ, we train it by following the settings of φ 2 for the full ImageNet dataset except that now the dimension corresponds to the output of the activations of the convolutional neural networks. The two architectures will be detailed in the appendix.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Large-Scale Image Recognition</head><p>We have witnessed an evolution of image datasets over the last few decades. The sizes of the early datasets are relatively small. Each dataset usually collects images on the order of tens of thousands. Representative datasets include Caltech-101 <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, Caltech-256 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, Pascal VOC <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, and CIFAR-10/100 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Nowadays, large-scale datasets are available with millions of detailed image annotations, e.g. ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and MS COCO <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>. With datasets of this scale, machine learning methods that have large capacity start to prosper, and the most successful ones are convolutional neural network based <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Few-Shot Image Recognition</head><p>Unlike large-scale image recognition, the research on few-shot learning has received limited attention from the community due to its inherent difficulty, thus is still at an early stage of development. As an early attempt, Fei-Fei et al. proposed a variational Bayesian framework for oneshot image classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. A method called Hierarchical Bayesian Program Learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> was later proposed to specifically approach the one-shot problem on character recognition by a generative model. On the same character recognition task, Koch et al. developed a siamese convolutional network <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> to learn the representation from the dataset and modeled the few-shot learning as a verification task. Later, Matching Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> was proposed to approach the few-shot learning task by modeling the problem as a k-way m-shot image retrieval problem using attention and memory models. Following this work, Ravi and Larochelle proposed a LSTM-based meta-learner optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and Chelsea et al. proposed a model-agnostic meta learning method <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>. Although they show state-of-theart performances on their few-shot learning tasks, they are not flexible for both large-scale and few-shot learning since k and m are fixed in their architectures. We will compare ours with these methods on their tasks for fair comparisons.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Unified Approach</head><p>Learning a metric then using nearest neighbor <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> is applicable but not necessarily optimal to the unified problem of large-scale and few-shot learning since it is possible to train a better model on the large-scale part of the dataset using the methods in §3.1. Mao et al. proposed a method called Learning like a Child <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> specifically for fast novel visual concept learning using hundreds of examples per category while keeping the original performance. However, this method is less effective when the training examples are extremely insufficient, e.g. &lt; 6 in this paper. Model Regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and SGM <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> are suitable for both large-scale and few-shot image recognition. The comparisons with them are presented in the appendix.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Results</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Full ImageNet Classification</head><p>In this section we describe our experiments and compare our approach with other strong baseline methods. As stated in §1, there are three aspects to consider in evaluating a method: (1) its performance on the few-shot set D few , <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> its performance on the large-scale set D large , and (3) its computation overhead of adding novel categories and the complexity of image inference. In the following paragraphs, we will cover the settings of the baseline methods, compare the performances on the large-scale and the few-shot sets, and discuss their efficiencies.</p><p>Baseline Methods The baseline methods must be applicable to both large-scale and few-shot learning settings. We compare our method with a fine-tuned 50-layer ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, Learning like a Child <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> with a pre-trained 50-layer ResNet as the starting network, Siamese-Triplet Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref> using three 50-layer ResNets with shared parameters, and the nearest neighbor using the pre-trained 50-layer ResNet convolutional features. We will elaborate individually on how to train and use them.</p><p>As mentioned in §2.4, we first train a 900-category classifier on D large . We will build other baseline methods using this classifier as the staring point. For convenience, we denote this classifier as R pt large , where pt stands for "pretrained". Next, we add the novel categories C few to each method. For the 50-layer ResNet, we fine tune R pt large with the newly added images by extending the fully connected layer to generate 1000 classification outputs. Note that we will limit the number of training samples of C few for the few-shot setting. For Learning like a Child, however, we  <ref type="table">Table 1</ref>: Comparing 1000-way accuracies with feature extractor a(·) pre-trained on D large . For different D few settings, red: the best few-shot accuracy, and blue: the second best.</p><p>fix the layers before the global average pooling layer, extend the fully connected layer to include 1000 classes, and only update the parameters for C few in the last classification layer. Since we have the full access to D large , we do not need Baseline Probability Fixation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. The nearest neighbor with cosine distance can be directly used for both tasks given the pre-trained deep features. The other method we compare is Siamese-Triplet Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. Siamese network is proposed to approach the few-shot learning problem on Omniglot dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. In our experiments, we find that its variant Triplet Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref> is more effective since it learns feature representation from relative distances between positive and negative pairs instead of directly doing binary classification from the feature distance. Therefore, we use the Triplet Network from <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> on the few-shot learning problem, and upgrade its body net to the pre-trained R pt large . We use cosine distance as the distance metric and fine-tune the Triplet Network. For inference, we use nearest neighbor with cosine distance. We use some techniques to improve the speed, which will be discussed later in the efficiency analysis.</p></div>

Specifically, we study the performances of different methods when D few has for each category 1, 2, and 3 samples. It is worth noting that our task is much harder than the previously studied few-shot learning: we are evaluating the top predictions out of 1000 candidate categories, i.e., 1000-way accuracies while previous work is mostly interested in 5-way or 20-way accuracies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</p><p>With the pre-trained R pt large , the training samples in D few are like invaders to the activation space for C large . Intuitively, there will be a trade-off between the performances on C large and C few . This is true especially for non-parametric methods. <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> shows the performances on the validation set of ILSVRC 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The second column is the percentage of data of D large in use, and the third column is the number of samples used for each category in D few . Note that finetuned ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and Learning like a Child <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> require fine-tuning while others do not.</p><p>Triplet Network is designed to do few-shot image inference by learning feature representations that adapt to the 41.08 ± 0.70% 51.04 ± 0.65% Matching Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> 43.56 ± 0.84% 55.31 ± 0.73% Meta-Learner LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> 43.44 ± 0.77% 60.60 ± 0.71% MAML <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> 48.70 ± 1.84% 63.11 ± 0.92% Ours-Simple 54.53 ± 0.40% 67.87 ± 0.20% Ours-WRN 59.60 ± 0.41% 73.74 ± 0.19% <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>: 5-way accuracies on MiniImageNet with 95% confidence interval. Red: the best, and blue: the second best.</p><p>assumed equal for every channel in cosine distance. This motivates us to investigate the impact of each channel of the activation space. For a fixed activation space, we define the impact of its j-th channel on mapping φ by I j (φ) = i |φ ij |. Similarly, we define the activation impact I j (·) on w pt large which is the parameter matrix of the last fully connected layer of R pt large . For cosine distance, I j (1) = 1, ∀j. Intuitively, we are evaluating the impact of each channel of a on the output by adding all the weights connected to it. For w pt large which is trained for the classification task using large-amounts of data, if we normalize I(w pt large ) to unity, the mean of I(w pt large ) over all channel j is 2.13e-2 and the standard deviation is 5.83e-3. w pt large does not use channels equally, either. In fact, φ 1 has a high similarity with w pt large . We show this by comparing the orders of the channels sorted by their impacts. Let top-k(S) find the indexes of the top-k elements of S. We define the top-k similarity of I(φ) and I(w where card is the cardinality of the set. The right image of <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref> plots the two similarities, from which we observe high similarity between φ and w pt large compared to the random order of 1. From this point of view, φ 1 outperforms the cosine distance due to its better usage of the activations.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">MiniImageNet Classification</head><p>In this subsection we compare our method with the previous state-of-the-arts on the MiniImageNet dataset. Unlike ImageNet classification, the task of MiniImageNet is to find the correct category from 5 candidates, each of which has 1 example or 5 examples for reference. The methods are only evaluated on D few , which has 20 categories. For each task, we uniformly sample 5 categories from D few . For each of the category, we randomly select one or five images as the references, depending on the settings, then regard the rest images of the 5 categories as the test images. For each task, we will have an average accuracy over this 5 categories. We repeat the task with different categories and report the mean of the accuracies with the 95% confidence interval. <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> summarizes the few-shot accuracies of our method and the previous state-of-the-arts. For fair comparisons, we implement two convolutional neural networks. The convolutional network of Ours-Simple is the same as that of Matching Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> while Ours-WRN uses WRN-28-10 <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> as stated in §2.4. The experimental results demonstrate that our average accuracies are better than the previous state-of-the-arts by a large margin for both the Simple and WRN implementations.</p><p>It is worth noting that the methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref> are not evaluated in the full ImageNet classification task. This is because the architectures of these methods, following the problem formulation of Matching Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, can only deal with the test tasks that are of the same number of reference categories and images as that of the training tasks, limiting their flexibilities for classification tasks of arbitrary number of categories and reference images. In contrast, our proposed method has no assumptions regarding the number of the reference categories and the images, while achieving good results on both tasks. From this perspective, our methods are better than the previous state-of-the-arts in terms of both the performance and the flexibility.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>In this paper, we study a novel problem: can we develop a unified approach that works for both large-scale and fewshot learning. Our motivation is based on the observation that in the final classification layer of a pre-trained neural network, the parameter vector and the activation vector have highly similar structures in space. This motivates us to learn a category-agnostic mapping from activations to parameters. Once this mapping is learned, the parameters for any novel category can be predicted by a simple forward pass, which is significantly more convenient than re-training used in parametric methods or enumeration of training set used in non-parametric approaches.</p><p>We experiment our novel approach on the MiniImageNet dataset and the challenging full ImageNet dataset. The challenges of the few-shot learning on the full ImageNet dataset are from the large number of categories (1000) and the very limited number (&lt; 4) of training samples for C few . On the full ImageNet dataset, we show promising results, achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy on novel categories by a significant margin while maintaining comparable performance on the large-scale classes. On the small MiniImageNet dataset, we also outperform the previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for learning a category-agnostic mapping.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Illustration of pre-training on D large (black) and few-shot novel category adaptation to D few (green).
