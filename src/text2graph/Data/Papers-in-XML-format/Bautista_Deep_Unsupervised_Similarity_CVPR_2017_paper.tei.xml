<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Visual similarities lie at the heart of a large number of computer vision tasks ranging from low-level image processing to high-level understanding of human poses or object classification. Of the numerous techniques for similarity learning, supervised methods have been a popular technique, leading to formulations in which similarity learning was casted as a ranking <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, regression <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> task. In recent years, with the advent of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), formulations based on a ranking (i.e. ordering) of pairs or triplets of samples according to their similarity have shown impressive results <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. However, to achieve this performance boost, these CNN architectures require millions of samples of supervised train- * Both authors contributed equally to this work. <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>.

In addition, not only similarities between images are important, but especially between objects and their parts. Annotating the fine-grained similarities between all these entities is a futile undertaking, in particular for the large-scale datasets typically used for training CNNs. Deep unsupervised learning of similarities is, therefore, of great interest to the vision community, since it does not require any labels for pre-training or fine-tuning. In this way we can utilize large image datasets without being limited by the need for costly manual annotations.</p><p>To utilize the vast amounts of available unlabeled training data, there is a quest to leverage context information intrinsic to images/video for self-supervision. However, this context is typically highly local (i.e position of patches in the same image <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, object tracks through short number of frames <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> or image impainting <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>), establishing relations between tuples <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or triplets <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> of images. Hence, these approaches utilize loss functions that order a positive I p and a negative I n image with respect to an anchor image I a so that, d(I a , I p ) &lt; d(I a , I n ). During train-ing, these methods rely on the CNN to indirectly learn comparisons between samples that were processed in independent training batches, and generalize to unseen data.</p><p>Instead of relying on the CNN to indirectly balance and learn sample comparisons unseen during training, a more natural approach is to explicitly encode richer relationships between samples as supervision. In this sense, an effective approach to tackle unsupervised similarity learning is to frame it as a series of surrogate (i.e. artificially created) classification tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>. Therefore, mutually similar samples are assigned the same class label, otherwise a different label. To obtain surrogate classification tasks, compact groups of mutually similar samples are computed by clustering <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> over a weak initial representation (e.g standard features such as HOG). Then, each group receives a mutually exclusive label and a CNN is trained to solve the associated classification problem, thereby learning a representation that encodes similarity in the intermediate layers. However, given the unreliability of initial similarities, a large number of training samples are neither mutually similar nor dissimilar and are, thus, not assigned to any of the compact surrogate classes. Consequentially they are ignored during training, hence overlooking important information. Also, classification can yield fairly coarse similarities, considering the discrete nature of the classes. Furthermore, the similarities learnt by the different classification tasks are not optimized jointly, which can lead to mutually contradicting relationships, since transitivity is not captured.</p><p>To overcome the fundamental limitations of these approaches we propose to: (i) Cast similarity learning as a surrogate classification task, using compact groups of mutually related samples as surrogates classes in a self-supervision spirit.</p><p>(ii) Combine classification with a partial ordering of samples. Even samples, which cannot be assigned to any surrogate class due to unreliable initial similarities are thus incorporated during training and in contrast to discrete classification, more fine-grained relationships are obtained due to the ordering. (iii) Explicitly optimize similarities in a given representation space, instead of using the representation space indirectly learnt by intermediate layers of a CNN trained for classification.(iv) Jointly optimize the surrogate classification tasks for similarity learning and the underlying grouping in a recurrent framework which is end-to-end trainable. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> shows a conceptual pipeline of the proposed approach.</p><p>Experimental evaluation on diverse tasks of pose estimation and object classification shows state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, thus underlining the wide applicability of the proposed approach. In the pose estimation experiments we show that our method learns a general representation, which can be transferred across datasets and is even valuable for initialization of supervised methods. In addition, in the object classification experiments we successfully leverage large unlabeled datasets to learn representations in the fashion of zero-shot learning.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Similarity learning has been a problem of major interest for the vision community from its early beginnings, due to its broad applications. With the advent of CNNs, several approaches have been proposed for supervised similarity learning using either pairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, or triplets <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> of images. Furthermore, recent works by Misra et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, and Doersh et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> showed that temporal information in videos and spatial context information in images can be utilized as a convenient supervisory signal for learning feature representation with CNNs in an unsupervised manner. However, either supervised or unsupervised, all these formulations for learning similarities require that the supervisory information scales quadratically for pairs of images, or cubically for triplets. This results in very large training time. Furthermore, tuple and triplet formulations advocate on the CNN to indirectly learn to conceal unrelated pairs of samples (i.e. pairs that were not tied to any anchor) that are processed in different, independent batches during training. Another recent approach that has been proposed for learning similarities in an unsupervised manner is to build a surrogate (i.e. an artificial) classification task either by utilizing heavy data augmentation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> or by clustering based on initial weak estimates of similarities <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>. The advantage of these approaches over tuple or triplet formulations is that several relationships of similarity (samples in the same class) and dissimilarity (samples in other classes) between samples are utilized during training. This results in more efficient training procedures, avoiding to sample millions of pairs or triplets of samples and encoding richer relationships between samples.</p><p>In addition, similarity learning has also been studied from the perspective of metric learning approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>. In the realm of supervised metric learning methods, Roweis et. al <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> formulated metric learning as a cross-entropy based classification problem in which all pairwise neighbouring samples are pulled together while nonneighbouring samples are pushed away. However, provided that clusters of neighbouring points can have an arbitrary large number of samples, this strategy fails to scale to the large image collections used for unsupervised learning of similarities. Further efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref> have tried to reduce the computational cost of performing all pairwise comparisons <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Recently, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> leveraged low-density classifiers to enable the use of large volumes of unlabelled data during training. However, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> cannot be successfully applied to the unsupervised scenario, since it requires a strongly supervised initialization , e.g. an ImageNet pre-trained model.  <ref type="figure">Figure 2</ref>. Visual summary of our approach. In the y-steps the clustering procedure computes surrogate classes (shaded in color) based on the current representation. In the œÜ-steps we learn a representation using the surrogate classes and partial orders of samples not assigned to any surrogate class (samples in white), by pulling them closer to their nearest classes and pushing them further from the rest.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Approach</head><p>In this section we show how to combine partially ordered sets (posets) of samples and surrogate classification to learn fine-grained similarities in an unsupervised manner. Key steps of the approach include: (i) Compute compact groups of mutually related samples and use each group as a surrogate class in a classification task.</p><p>(ii) Learn fine-grained similarities by modelling partial orderings to also leverage those samples that cannot be assigned to a surrogate class.</p><p>(iii) Due to the interdependence of grouping and similarity learning we jointly optimize them in a recurrent framework. <ref type="figure">Fig. 2</ref> shows a visual example of the main steps of our approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Grouping</head><p>To formulate unsupervised similarity learning as a classification approach we need to define surrogate classes, since labels are not available. To compute these surrogate classes we first gather compact groups of samples using standard feature distances (LDA whitened HOG <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>). HOG-LDA is a computationally effective foundation for estimating similarities between a large number of samples. Let our training set be defined as X ‚àà R n√óp , where n is the total number of samples and x i is the i‚àíth sample. Then, the HOG-LDA similarity between a pair of samples x i and x j is defined as</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">s ij = exp(‚àí œÜ(x i ) ‚àí œÜ(x j ) 2 ). Here œÜ(x i ) ‚àà R 1√ód is the d‚àídimensional representation of sam- ple x i in the HOG-LDA feature space.</formula><p>Albeit unreliable to relate all samples to another, HOG-LDA similarities can be used to find the nearest and furthest neighbors, as highly similar and dissimilar samples to a given anchor sample x i stand out from the similarity distribution. Therefore, to build surrogate classes (i.e. compact groups of samples) we group each x i with its immediate neighborhood (samples with similarity within the top 5%) so that all merged samples are mutually similar. These groups are compact, differ in size, and may be mutually overlapping. To reduce redundancy, highly overlapping classes are subsequently merged by agglomerative clustering, which terminates if intra-class similarity of a surrogate class is less than half of its constituents. We denote the set of samples assigned to the c-th surrogate class as C c , and the label assigned to each sample as</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">y ‚àà {‚àí1, 0, . . . , C ‚àí 1}</formula><p>1√ón , where the label assigned to sample x i is denoted as y i . All samples that are not assigned to any surrogate class get label ‚àí1.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Partially Ordered Sets</head><p>Provided the unreliability of similarity estimates used for building surrogate classes, a large number of samples cannot be assigned to any class, because they are neither similar nor dissimilar to any sample. This deprives the optimization of using all available data during training. As a result, fine-grained similarities are poorly represented, since learning to classify surrogate classes does not model relative similarities of samples that are not assigned to any class. To overcome this limitation we leverage the information encoded in posets of samples relative to a surrogate class. That is, for each sample not assigned to any surrogate class (i.e. x i : y i = ‚àí 1) we compute a soft assignment (i.e. a similarity score) to the Z nearest surrogate classes C z : z ‚àà {1, . . . , Z}. Once all unlabeled points are softly assigned to their Z nearest classes, we obtain as a result, a poset P c for each class. Thus, a poset P c is a set of samples which are softly assigned to class C c . Posets can be of variable size and partially overlapping. We show a visual example of a poset in <ref type="figure">Fig. 3</ref>.</p><p>Formally, given a deep feature representation œÜ Œ∏ (e.g an arbitrary layer in a CNN with parameters Œ∏), and a surrogate class C c , a poset of unlabeled samples P c = {x j , . . . , x k } : y j = y k = ‚àí 1 ‚àÄ j, k with respect to C c is defined as:</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">‚àÄ xi‚ààCc {exp(‚àí œÜ Œ∏ (x i ) ‚àí œÜ Œ∏ (x j ) 2 ) &gt; exp(‚àí œÜ Œ∏ (x i ) ‚àí œÜ Œ∏ (x k ) 2 )} ‚áê‚áí j &lt; k‚àÄj, k. (1)</formula><p>In Eq. (1) a poset is defined by computing the similarity of unlabeled sample x j to all the samples in class C c , which during training is costly to optimize. However, due the compactness of our grouping approach, which only gathers very similar samples into surrogate C c , we can effectively replace the similarities to all points in C c by the similarity to a representative samplex c in C c , which is the class medioid,x c = argmin <ref type="figure">Figure 3</ref>. Visual interpretation of a poset. Samples assigned to a surrogate class are shaded in a particular color, while samples not assigned to surrogate classes are represented in white.</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">xi‚ààCc xj ‚ààCc œÜ Œ∏ (x i ) ‚àí œÜ Œ∏ (x j ) 2 . r 1 P 1 = {x 1 ,...,x 5 } x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 r 1</formula><p>Following the definition of a poset in Eq. 1, the widely adopted tuple and triplet formulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref> are a specific case of a poset in which P contains at most 2 samples, and C c contains just one. In this sense, deep feature representations œÜ (i.e. CNNs) trained using triplet losses seek to sort two pairs of samples (i.e. anchor-positive and anchor-negative) according to their similarity. As a result, triplet formulations rely on the CNN to indirectly learn to compare and reconcile the vast number of unrelated sampled pairs that were processed on different, independent mini-batches during training. In contrast, posets, explicitly encode an ordering between a large number of sample pairs (i.e pairs consisting of an unlabeled sample and its nearest class representative). Therefore, using posets during training enforces the CNN to order all unlabeled samples x i : y i = ‚àí 1 according to their similarity to the Z nearest class representatives r z i : z ‚àà {1, . . . , Z}, where r z i is the z‚àíth nearestx c to sample x i , learning fine-grained interactions between samples. Posets generalize tuple and triplet formulations by encoding similarity relationships between unlabeled samples to make a decision whether to move closer to a surrogate class. This effectively increases our training set when compared to just using the samples assigned to surrogate classes, and allows us to model finer relationships.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Objective function</head><p>In our formulation, we strive for a trade-off model in which we jointly optimize a surrogate classification task and a metric loss to capture the fine-grained similarities encoded in posets. Therefore, we seek an objective function L which penalizes: (i) misclassifications of samples x i with respect to their surrogate label y i , and (ii) similarities of samples x i : y i = ‚àí1. with respect to their Z nearest class representatives. The objective function should inherit the reliability of framing similarity learning as surrogate classification tasks, while using posets to incorporate those training samples that were previously ignored because they could not be assigned to any surrogate class. In particular, we require the CNN to pull samples from posets x i ‚àà P c closer to their Z nearest class representatives, while pushing them further from all other class representatives in a training mini-batch. Furthermore, we require that unreliable similarities (i.e. samples that are far from all surrogate classes), vanish from the loss, rendering the learning process robust to outliers. In addition, in order to capture fine-grained similarity relationships, we want to directly optimize the feature space œÜ in which similarities are computed.</p><p>Therefore</p><note type="other">, let R z ‚àà R n√ód denote the z-th nearest class representatives of each unlabeled sample x i : y i = ‚àí 1, where r z i is the z-th nearest class representative of sample x i , and Œ∏ be the parameters of the CNN. Then, our objective function combines the surrogate classification loss L 1 with our poset loss L 2 :</note><formula xml:id="formula_4">L(x i , y i , R; Œ∏) = 1 N N i=1 L 1 (x i , y i ) + ŒªL 2 (x i , R, œÜ),<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where Œª is a scalar and,</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L 1 (x i , y i ; Œ∏) = ‚àí log exp(t Œ∏ i,yi ) C‚àí1 j=0 exp(t Œ∏ i,j ) ‚ú∂ yi =‚àí1 ,<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_6">L 2 (x i , R; Œ∏) = = ‚àí log Z z=1 exp( ‚àí1 2œÉ 2 ( œÜ Œ∏ (x i ) ‚àí œÜ Œ∏ (r z i ) 2 2 ‚àí Œ≥)) C ‚Ä≤ j=1 exp( ‚àí1 2œÉ 2 œÜ Œ∏ (x i ) ‚àí œÜ Œ∏ (r j ) 2 2 ) .<label>(4)</label></formula><p>In Eq. (3), t Œ∏ i = t Œ∏ (x i ) are the logits of sample x i for a CNN with parameters Œ∏. In Eq. (4) C ‚Ä≤ is the number of surrogate classes in the batch, œÉ is the standard deviation of the current assignment of samples to surrogate classes, and Œ≥ is the margin between surrogate classes. It is note-worthy that Eq. (4) can scale to an arbitrary number of classes, since it does not depend on a fixed-sized output target layer, avoiding the shortcomings of large output spaces in CNN learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> 1 . Finally, note that if Z = 1 the problem reduces to a cross-entropy based classification, where the standard logits (i.e. outputs of the last layer) are replaced by the similarity to the surrogate class representative in feature space œÜ. However, for Z &gt; 1 relative similarities between surrogate classes enter into play and posets encoding fine-grained interactions naturally arise (cf. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>). In all our experiments we set Z &gt;= 2. During training, CNN parameters Œ∏ are updated by error-backpropagation with stochastic minibatch gradient descent. In typical classification scenarios the training set is randomly shuffled to avoid biased gradient computations that hamper the learning process. Therefore, at training time we build our mini-batches of samples by selecting a random set of samples not assigned to a surrogate </p><note type="other">4.

Evidently the model benefits from jointly optimizing {y, Œ∏}. class x i : y i = ‚àí1, and retrieving all the surrogate classes C c which contain x i</note><p>in their poset x i ‚àà P c . In <ref type="figure">Fig. 4</ref> we take as a study case the long jump category of the Olympic Sports dataset (cf. Sec. 4) and show the L decreases along iterations. In particular, we show that if y and Œ∏ are optimized jointly we attain better performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4.">Joint Optimization</head><p>In our setup, the grouping and similarity learning tasks are mutually dependent on each other. Therefore, we strive to jointly learn a representation œÜ Œ∏ , which captures similarity relationships, and an assignment of samples to surrogate classes y. A natural way to model such dependence in variables is to use a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. In particular, RNNs have shown a great potential to model relationships on sequential problems, where each prediction depends on previous observations. Inspired by this insight, we employ a recurrent optimization technique. Following the standard process for learning RNNs we jointly learn {y, Œ∏} by unrolling the optimization into steps. At time step m we update y and Œ∏ as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">y (m) = argmax y G(X; œÜ Œ∏ (m‚àí1) , y (m‚àí1) ) s.t. n i:yi=c 1 &gt; t, ‚àÄ c‚àà{0,...,C‚àí1} ,<label>(5)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_8">Œ∏ (m) = argmin Œ∏ L(X, y (m) , R (m) ; Œ∏ (m‚àí1) ).<label>(6)</label></formula><p>Where G is a cost function of pairwise clustering that favors compactness based on sample similarities, which are entailed by the representation œÜ </p><formula xml:id="formula_9">exp(‚àí œÜ Œ∏ (x i ) ‚àí œÜ Œ∏ (x j ) 2 ) n j:yj =c 1 2 .<label>(7)</label></formula><p>In order to avoid the trivial solution of assigning a single sample to each cluster we initialize y (0) with the grouping introduced in Sec. 3.1 using HOG-LDA as our initial œÜ. In our implementation, y follows a relaxed one-hot encoding, which can be interpreted as an affinity of samples to clusters. Then, Eq. (5) becomes differentiable and is optimized using SGD. Subsequently, L learns a deep similarity encoding representation œÜ Œ∏(m) on samples X using assignments y (m) and partial orders of X with respect to representatives R (m) . In a typical RNN scenario, for each training iteration the RNN is unrolled m steps. However, this would be inefficient in our setup, as the CNN representation œÜ Œ∏ is learnt using SGD, and thus, requires to be optimized for a large number of iterations to be reliable, especially at the first unrolled steps. Therefore, at each step m, we find Œ∏ (m) by optimizing Eq. (6) for a number of iterations, fixing y (m) and R (m) . Then, we use Œ∏ (m) to find the optimal y (m+1) by optimizing G using SGD. The presented RNN can also be interpreted as block-coordinate descent <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, where the grouping y is fixed while updating the representation parameters Œ∏ and vice versa. The convergence of block coordinate-descent methods has been largely discussed obtaining guarantees of convergence to a stationary point <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</p></div>

In all our experiments we adopt the AlexNet architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.">Human Pose Estimation</head><p>To evaluate the proposed approach in the context of pose estimation we consider 3 different datasets, Olympic Sports (OS), Leeds Sports Pose (LSP), and MPII-Pose (MPI). We show that our unsupervised method is valuable for a range of retrieval problems: For OS we evaluate zero-shot retrieval of detailed postures. On LSP, we perform zero-shot and semi-supervised estimation of pose. Finally, on MPII we evaluate our approach as an initialization for a supervised learning approach for pose estimation. In contrast to other methods that fine-tune supervised initializations of a CNN, we train our AlexNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> architecture from scratch.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.1">Olympic Sports</head><p>The Olympic Sports dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> is a compilation of video sequences of different 16 sports competitions, containing more than 110000 frames overall. We use the approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> to compute person bounding boxes and utilize this large dataset to learn a general representation that encodes fine-grained posture similarities. In order to do so, we initially compute 20000 surrogate classes consisting of 8 samples in average. Then, we utilize partially ordered sets of samples not assigned to any surrogate classes. To train our RNN we use the optimization approach described in Sec. 3.4, where the RNN is unrolled on m = 10 steps. At each unrolled step, Œ∏ is updated during 20000 iterations of error-backpropagation. To evaluate our representation on fine-grained posture retrieval we utilize the annotations provided by <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> on their project webpage <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> and follow their evaluation protocol, using their annotations only for testing. We compare our method with CliqueCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> by directly evaluating their models provided at 2 , the triplet formulation of Shuffle&amp;Learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, the tuple approach of Doersch et. al <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, Exemplar-CNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, Alexnet <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Exemplar-SVMs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and HOG-LDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>. For completeness we also include a version of our model that was initialized with Imagenet model <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. During training we use as œÜ the fc7 output representation of Alexnet and compute similarities using cosine distance. We use Tensorflow <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> for our implementation. (i) For CliqueCNN, Shuffle&amp; Learn, and Doersh et. al methods we use the models downloaded from their respective project websites. (ii) Exemplar-CNN is trained using the best performing parameters reported in <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and the 64c5-128c5-256c5-512f architecture. Then we use the output of fc4 and compute 4-quadrant max pooling. (iii) Exemplar-SVM was trained on the exemplar frames using the HOG descriptor. The samples for hard negative mining come from all categories except the one that an exemplar is from. We performed cross-validation to find an optimal number of negative mining rounds (less than three). The class weights of the linear SVM were set as C 1 = 0.5 and C 2 = 0.01. During training of our approach, each image in the training set is augmented by performing random translation, scaling and rotation to improve invariance with respect to these.</p><p>In Tab. 1 we show the average AuC over all categories for the different methods. When compared with the best runner up <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, the proposed approach improves the performance 2% (the method in <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> was pre-trained on Imagenet). This improvement is due to the additional relationships established by posets on samples not assigned to any surrogate class, which <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> ignored during training. In addition, when compared to the state-of-the-art methods that leverage tuples <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or triplets <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> for training a CNN from scratch, our approach shows 16% higher performance. This is explained by the more detailed similarity relationships encoded in each poset, which in tuple methods the CNN has to learn implicitly.</p><p>In addition to the quantitative analysis we also perform a qualitative evaluation of the similarities learnt by the proposed method. In order to do so, we take a sequence from 2 https://asanakoy.github.io/cliquecnn/ HOG-LDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> Ex the long jump category of Olympic Sports and select two representatives {r 1 , r r } with a gap of 8 frames between them and show in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref> the poset learnt by our approach. The top row shows two representatives of the same sequence highlighted in red and the remaining sub-sequence between them in blue. In the bottom row, we present the poset learnt by our approach. Since r 1 and r 2 show different parts of a short gait cycle, the similarity relations in the poset should set other frames into perspective and order them. And indeed, we observe that the poset successfully encodes this temporal coherence by ordering frames from other sequences that fit in this gap. This is even more interesting, since during training absolutely no temporal structure was introduced in the model, as we were training on only individual frames. These results spurred our interest to also apply the learnt posets for video reconstruction using only few sparse representatives per sequence, additional results can be found in the supplementary material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.2">Leeds Sports Pose</head><p>After evaluating the proposed method for fine-grained posture retrieval, we tackle the problem of zero-shot pose estimation on the LSP dataset. That is, we transfer the pose representation learnt on Olympic Sports to the LSP dataset and retrieve similar poses based on their similarity. The LSP <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> dataset is one of the most widely used benchmarks for pose estimation. In order to evaluate our model we then employ the fine-grained pose representation learnt by our approach on OS, and transfer it to LSP, without doing any further training. For evaluation we use the representation to compute visual similarities and find nearest neighbours to a query frame. Since the evaluation is zero-shot, joint labels are not available. At test time we therefore estimate the joint coordinates of a query person by finding the most similar frame from the training set and taking its joint coordinates. We then compare our method with Alexnet <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> pre-trained on Imagenet, the triplet approach of Misra et. al (Shuffle&amp;Learn) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> and CliqueCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>. In addition, we also report an upper bound on the performance that can be achieved by zero-shot evaluation using ground-truth similarities. Here the most similar pose for a query is given by the frame, which is closest in average distance of groundtruth pose annotations. This is the best one can achieve without a parametric model for pose (the performance gap to 100% shows the discrepancy between poses in test and  train set). For completeness, we compare with a fully supervised state-of-the-art approach for pose estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. For computing simialarities we use the same experimental settings described in Sect. 4.1.1, where œÜ is the representation extracted from pool5 layer of Alexnet. In Tab. 2 we show the PCP@0.5 obtained by the different methods. For a fair comparison with CliqueCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> (which was pretrained on Imagenet), we include a version of our method trained using Imagenet initialization. Our approach significantly improves the visual similarities learned using both Imagenet pre-trained AlexNet and CliqueCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, obtaining a performance boost of at least 4% in PCP score. In addition, when trained from scratch without any pre-training on Imagenet our model outperforms the recent triplet model of <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> by 4%, due to the fact that posets are a natural generalization of triplet models, which encode finer relationships between samples. Finally, it is notable that even though our pose representation is transferred from a different dataset without fine-tuning on LSP, it obtains state-of-the-art performance. In <ref type="figure">Fig. 6</ref> we show a qualitative comparison of the part predictions of the supervised approach in <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> trained on LSP, with the heatmaps yielded by our zero-shot approach.</p><p>In addition to the zero-shot learning experiments we also used our pose representation learnt on Olympic Sports as an initialization for learning the DeepPose method <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> on LSP in a semi-supervised fashion. To evaluate the validity of our representation we compare the performance obtained by DeepPose <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, when trained with one of the following models as initialization: random initialization, Shuf-  <ref type="table">Table 3</ref>. PCP measure for each method on Leeds Sports dataset using different methods as initialization for the DeepPose method <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</p><p>fle&amp;Learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> (triplet model), and our approach trained on OS. For completeness, we also compared with Imagenet pre-trained AlexNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>. Tab. 3 shows the PCP@0.5 obtained by training DeepPose (stg-1) using their best reported parameters. The obtained results show that our representation successfully encodes pose information, obtaining a performance boost of 9% when compared with a random initialization (that our model starts from), since we learn general pose features that act as a regularizer during training. A note-worthy comparison is that the difference between utilizing Imagenet pre-training, which uses 1.2 million labeled images, and our unsupervised learning approach is just 5%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1.3">MPII Pose</head><p>We now evaluate our approach in the challenging MPII Pose dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> which is a state of the art benchmark for evaluation of articulated human pose estimation. The dataset includes around 25K images containing over 40K people with annotated body joints. MPII Pose is a particularly challenging dataset because of the clutter, occlusion and number of persons appearing in images. To evaluate our approach in MPII Pose we follow the semi-supervised training protocol used for LSP and compare the performance obtained by DeepPose <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, when trained using as initialization each of the following models: Random initialization, Shuffle&amp;Learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> (triplet model) and our approach trained on OS. For completion, we also evaluate Imagenet pre-trained AlexNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>  ing their best reported parameters with the different initializations. The performance obtained on MPII Pose benchmark shows that our unsupervised representation successfully scales to challenging datasets, successfully dealing with clutter, occlusions and multiple persons. In particular, when comparing our unsupervised initialization with a random initialization we obtain a 7% performance boost, which indicates that our features encode a robust notion of pose that is robust to the clutter present in MPII dataset. Furthermore, we obtain a 3% improvement over the Shuffle&amp;Learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> approach, due to the finer-grained relationships encoded by posets. Finally, it is important to note that the difference between utilizing Imagenet pre-trained AlexNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and our unsupervised learning approach is just 5%.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2.">Object Classification on PASCAL VOC</head><p>To evaluate the general applicability of our approach, let us now switch from human pose estimation to the challenging diverse problem of object classification. We classify object bounding boxes of the PASCAL VOC 2007 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> dataset in zero-shot fashion by predicting the most similar images to a query. The object representation needed for computing similarities, we obtain without supervision information, using visual similarities of the triplet model of Wang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> as initializiation. Neither this initialization nor our method apply pre-training or fine tuning on ImageNet or Pascal VOC. Using this initialization we then compute an initial clustering on 1000 surrogate classes with 8 samples in average, on the training set images. We then utilize partially ordered sets of samples not assigned to any class, and jointly optimize assignments and representation using the recurrent optimization approach describe in Sec. 3.4. The representation œÜ used to compute similarities on the PAS-CAL datasets is for each CNN method that we now compare the fc6 layer. We compare our approach with HOG-LDA <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, the triplet approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, CliqueCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Imagenet pre-trained AlexNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and RCNN <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. In Tab. 5 we show the classification performance for all methods for k = 5 (for k &gt; 5 there was only insignificant performance improvement). Our approach improves upon the initial similarities of the unsupervised triplet approach of <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> to yield a performance gain of 6% without requiring any supervision information or fine-tuning on PASCAL. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusions</head><p>We have presented an unsupervised approach to similarity learning based on CNNs by framing it as a combination of surrogate classification tasks and poset ordering. This generalizes the widely used tuple and triplet losses to establish relations between large numbers of samples. Similarity learning then becomes a joint optimization problem of grouping samples into surrogate classes while learning the deep similarity encoding representation. In the experimental evaluation the proposed approach has shown competitive performance when compared to state-of-the-art results, learning fine-grained similarity relationships in the context of human pose estimation and object classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> .</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_1"><head>Figure</head><label></label><figDesc>Figure 4.
