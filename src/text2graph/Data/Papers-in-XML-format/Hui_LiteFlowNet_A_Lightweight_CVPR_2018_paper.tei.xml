<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Optical flow estimation is a long-standing problem in computer vision. Due to the well-known aperture problem, optical flow is not directly measurable <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>. Hence, the estimation is typically solved by energy minimization in a coarse-to-fine framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>. This class of techniques, however, involves complex energy optimization and thus it is not scalable for applications that demand real-time estimation.</p><p>FlowNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and its successor FlowNet2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, have marked a milestone by using CNN for optical flow estimation. Their accuracies especially the successor are approaching that of state-of-the-art energy minimization approaches, while the speed is several orders of magnitude faster. To push the envelop of accuracy, FlowNet2 is designed as a cascade of variants of FlowNet that each network in the cascade refines the preceding flow field by contributing on the flow increment between the first image and the warped second image. The model, as a result, comprises over 160M parameters, which could be formidable in many applications. A recent network termed SPyNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> attempts a network with smaller size of 1.2M parameters by adopting image warping in each pyramid level. Nonetheless, the accuracy can only match that of FlowNet but not FlowNet2. The objective of this study is to explore alternative CNN architectures for accurate flow estimation yet with high efficiency. Our work is inspired by the successes of FlowNet2 and SPyNet, but we further drill down the key elements to fully unleash the potential of deep convolutional network combined with classical principles.</p><p>There are two general principles to improve the design of FlowNet2 and SPyNet. The first principle is pyramidal feature extraction. The proposed network, dubbed LiteFlowNet, consists of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder maps the given image pair, respectively, into two pyramids of multi-scale high-dimensional features. The decoder then estimates the flow field in a coarse-to-fine framework. At each pyramid level, the decoder infers the flow field by selecting and using the features of the same resolution from the feature pyramids. This design leads to a lighter network compared to FlowNet2 that adopts U-Net architecture <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> for flow inference. In comparison to SPyNet, our network separates the process of feature extraction and flow estimation. This helps us to better pinpoint the bottleneck of accuracy and model size.</p><p>The second general principle is feature warping. FlowNet2 and SPyNet warp the second image towards the first image in the pair using the previous flow estimate, and then refine the estimate using the feature maps generated by the warped and the first images. Warping an image and then generating the feature maps of the warped image are two ordered steps. We find that the two steps can be reduced to a single one by directly warping the feature maps of the second image, which have been computed by the encoder. This one-step feature warping process reduces the more discriminative feature-space distance instead of the RGB-space distance between the two images. This makes our network more powerful and efficient in addressing the flow problem.</p><p>We now highlight the more specific differences between our network and existing CNN-based optical flow estimation frameworks: 1) Cascaded flow inference -At each pyramid level, we introduce a novel cascade of two lightweight networks. Each of them has a feature warping (f-warp) layer to displace the feature maps of the second image towards the first image using the flow estimate from the previous level. Flow residue is computed to further reduce the feature-space distance between the images. This design is advantageous to the conventional design of using a single network for flow inference. First, the cascade progressively improves flow accuracy thus allowing an early correction of the estimate without passing more errors to the next level. Second, this design allows seamless integration with descriptor matching. We assign a matching network to the first inference. Consequently, pixel-accuracy flow field can be generated first and then refined to sub-pixel accuracy in the subsequent inference network. Since at each pyramid level the feature-space distance between the images has been reduced by feature warping, we can use a rather short displacement than <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> to establish the cost volume. Besides, matching is performed only at sampled positions and thus a sparse cost-volume is aggregated. This effectively reduces the computational burden raised by the explicit matching.</p><p>2) Flow regularization -The cascaded flow inference resembles the role of data fidelity in energy minimization methods. Using data term alone, vague flow boundaries and undesired artifacts exist in flow fields. To tackle this problem, local flow consistency and co-occurrence between flow boundaries and intensity edges are commonly used as the cues to regularize flow field. Some of the representative methods include anisotropic image-driven <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, image-and flow-driven <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, and complementary <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> regularizations. After cascaded flow inference, we allow the flow field to be further regularized by our novel feature-driven local convolution (f-lconv) layer 1 at each pyramid level. The kernels of such a local convolution are adaptive to the pyramidal features from the encoder, flow estimate and occlusion probability map. This makes the flow regularization to be both flow-and image-aware. To our best knowledge, state-ofthe-art CNNs do not explore such a flow regularization.</p><p>The effectiveness of the aforementioned contributions are depicted in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Figure 1</ref>. In summary, we propose a compact LiteFlowNet to estimate optical flow. Our network innovates the useful elements from conventional methods. e.g., brightness constraint in data fidelity to pyramidal CNN features and image warping to CNN feature warping. More specifically, we present a cascaded flow inference with feature warping and flow regularization in each pyramid level, which are new in the literature. Overall, our network outperforms FlowNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and SPyNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and is on par with the recent FlowNet2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, while having 30 times fewer parameters and being 1.36 times faster than FlowNet2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Here, we briefly review some of the major approaches for optical flow estimation.</p><p>Variational methods. Since the pioneering work by Horn and Schunck <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, variational methods have dominated optical flow estimation. Brox et al. address illumination changes by combining the brightness and gradient constancy assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>. Brox et al. integrate rich descriptors into variational formulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>. In DeepFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, Weinzaepfel et al. propose to correlate multi-scale patches and incorporate this as the matching term in functional. In PatchMatch Filter <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, Lu et al. establish dense correspondence using the superpixel-based PatchMatch <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Revaud et al.</ref> propose a method EpicFlow that uses externally matched flows as initialization and then performs interpolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>. Zimmer et al. design the complementary regularization that exploits directional information from the constraints imposed in data term <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. Our network that infers optical flow and performs flow regularization is inspired by the use of data fidelity and regularization in variational methods.</p><p>Machine learning methods. Black et al. propose to represent complex image motion as a linear combination of the learned basis vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Roth et al.</ref> formulates the prior probability of flow field as Field-of-Experts model <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> that captures higher order spatial statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>. <ref type="bibr">Sun et al. study</ref> the probabilistic model of brightness inconstancy in a highorder random field framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>. Nir et al. represent image motion using the over-parameterization model <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>. Rosenbaum et al. model the local statistics of optical flow using Gaussian mixtures <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>. Given a set of sparse matches, Wulff et al. propose to regress them to a dense flow field using a set of basis flow fields (PCA-Flow) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>. It can be shown that the parameterized model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref> can be efficiently implemented using CNN.</p><p>CNN-based methods. In the work of Fischer et al. termed FlowNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, a post-processing step that involves energy minimization is required to reduce smoothing effect across flow boundaries. This process is not end-to-end trainable. In our work, we present an end-to-end approach that performs in-network flow regularization using the proposed f-lconv layer, which plays similar role as the regularization term in variational methods. In FlowNet2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, Ilg et al. introduce a huge network cascade (over 160M parameters) that consists of variants of FlowNet. The cascade improves flow accuracy with an expense of model size and computational complexity. Our model uses a more efficient architecture containing 30 times fewer parameters than FlowNet2 while the performance is on par with it. A compact network termed SPyNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> from Ranjan et al. is inspired from spatial pyramid. Nevertheless, the accuracy is far below FlowNet2. A small-sized variant of our network outperforms SPyNet while being 1.33 times smaller in the model size. Zweig et al. present a network to interpolate third-party sparse flows but requiring off-the-shelf edge detector <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. DeepFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> that involves convolution and pooling operations is however not a CNN, since the "filter weights" are non-trainable image patches. According to the terminology used in FlowNet, DeepFlow uses correlation.</p><p>An alternative approach for establishing point correspondence is to match image patches. Zagoruyko et al. first introduce to CNN-feature matching <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>. Güney et al. find feature representation and formulate optical flow estimation in MRF <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>. Bailer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> use multi-scale features and then perform feature matching as Flow Fields <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>. Although pixel-wise matching can establish accurate point correspondence, the computational demand is too high for practical use (it takes several seconds even a GPU is used). As a tradeoff, Fischer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and Ilg et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> perform feature matching only at a reduced spatial resolution. We reduce the computational burden of feature matching by using a short-ranged matching of warped CNN features at sampled positions and a sub-pixel refinement at every pyramid level.</p><p>We are inspired by the feature transformation used in Spatial Transformer <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>. Our network uses the proposed f-warp layer to displace each channel 2 of the given vector-valued feature according to the provided flow field. Unlike Spatial Transformer, f-warp layer is not fully constrained and is a relaxed version of it as the flow field is not parameterized. While transformation in FlowNet2 and SPyNet is limited to images, our decider network is a more generic warping network that warps high-level CNN features.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">LiteFlowNet</head><p>LiteFlowNet is composed of two compact sub-networks that are specialized in pyramidal feature extraction and optical flow estimation as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. Since the spatial dimension of feature maps is contracting in feature extraction and that of flow fields is expanding in flow estimation, we call the two sub-networks as NetC and NetE respectively. NetC transforms any given image pair into two pyramids of multi-scale high-dimensional features. NetE consists of cascaded flow inference and regularization modules that estimate coarse-to-fine flow fields. Pyramidal Feature Extraction. As shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>, NetC is a two-stream network in which the filter weights are shared across the two streams. Each of them functions as a feature descriptor that transforms an image I to a pyramid of multi-scale high-dimensional features {F k (I)} from the highest spatial resolution (k = 1) to the lowest spatial resolution (k = L). The pyramidal features are generated by stride-s convolutions with the reduction of spatial resolution by a factor s up the pyramid. In the following, we omit the subscript k that indicates the level of pyramid for brevity. We use F i to represent CNN features for I i . When we discuss the operations in a pyramid level, the same operations are applicable to other levels. Feature Warping. At each pyramid level, a flow field is inferred from high-level features F 1 and F 2 of images I 1 and I 2 . Flow inference becomes more challenging if I 1 and I 2 are captured far away from each other. With the motivation of image warping used in conventional methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref> and recent CNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> for addressing large-displacement flow, we propose to reduce feature-space distance between F 1 and F 2 by feature warping (f-warp). Specifically, F 2 is warped towards F 1 by f-warp via flow estimateẋ to</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">F 2 (x) F 2 (x +ẋ) ∼ F 1 (x)</formula><p>. This allows our network to infer residual flow between F 1 and F 2 that has smaller flow magnitude (more details in Section 3.1) but not the complete flow field that is more difficult to infer. Unlike conventional methods, f-warp is performed on high-level CNN features but not on images. This makes our network more powerful and efficient in addressing the optical flow problem. To allow end-to-end training, F is interpolated to F for any sub-pixel displacementẋ as follows: </p><formula xml:id="formula_1">F(x) = x i s ∈N (xs) F(x i s ) 1 − x s − x i s 1 − y s − y i s ,<label>(1)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_2">k (I2) in red, k ∈ [1, 3])</formula><p>. NetE yields multi-scale flow fields that each of them is generated by a cascaded flow inference module M :S (in blue color, including a descriptor matching unit M and a sub-pixel refinement unit S) and a regularization module R (in green color). Flow inference and regularization modules correspond to data fidelity and regularization terms in conventional energy minimization methods respectively.</p><p>where x s = x +ẋ = (x s , y s ) ⊤ denotes the source coordinates in the input feature map F that defines the sample point, x = (x, y) ⊤ denotes the target coordinates of the regular grid in the interpolated feature map F, and N (x s ) denotes the four pixel neighbors of x s . The above bilinear interpolation allows back-propagation during training as its gradients can be efficiently computed <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Cascaded Flow Inference</head><p>At each pyramid level of NetE, pixel-by-pixel matching of high-level features yields coarse flow estimate. A subsequent refinement on the coarse flow further improves it to sub-pixel accuracy.</p><p>First Flow Inference (descriptor matching). Point correspondence between I 1 and I 2 is established through computing correlation of high-level feature vectors in individual pyramidal features F 1 and F 2 as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">c(x, d) = F 1 (x) · F 2 (x + d)/N,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where c is the matching cost between point x in F 1 and point</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">x + d in F 2 , d ∈ Z is the displacement vector from x,</formula><p>and N is the length of the feature vector. A cost volume C is built by aggregating all the matching costs into a 3D grid. We reduce the computational burden raised by costvolume processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> in three ways: 1) We perform short-range matching at every pyramid level instead of longrange matching at a single level. 2) We reduce feature-space distance between F 1 and F 2 by warping F 2 towards F 1 using our proposed f-warp through flow estimate 3ẋ from 3ẋ from previous level needs to be upsampled in spatial resolution (denoted by "↑s") and magnitude (multiplied by a scalar s) to sẋ ↑s for matching the spatial resolution of the pyramidal features at the current level. previous level. 3) We perform matching only at the sampled positions in the pyramid levels of high-spatial resolution. The sparse cost volume is interpolated in the spatial dimension to fill the missed matching costs for the unsampled positions. The first two techniques effectively reduce the searching space needed, while the last technique reduces the frequency of matching per pyramid level.</p><p>In the descriptor matching unit M , residual flow ∆ẋ m is inferred by filtering the cost volume C as illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. A complete flow fieldẋ m is computed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">x m = M C(F 1 , F 2 ; d) ∆ẋm +sẋ ↑s .<label>(3)</label></formula><p>Second Flow Inference (sub-pixel refinement). Since the cost volume in descriptor matching unit is aggregated by measuring pixel-by-pixel correlation, flow estimateẋ m from the previous inference is only up to pixel-level accuracy. We introduce the second flow inference in the wake of descriptor matching as shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Figure 3</ref>. It aims to refine the pixel-level flow fieldẋ m to sub-pixel accuracy. This prevents erroneous flows being amplified by upsampling and passing to the next pyramid level. Specifically, F 2 is warped to F 2 via flow estimateẋ m . Sub-pixel refinement unit S yields a more accurate flow fieldẋ s by minimizing feature-space distance between F 1 and F 2 through computing residual flow ∆ẋ s as the following:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">x s = S F 1 , F 2 ,ẋ m ∆ẋs +ẋ m .<label>(4)</label></formula></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Flow Regularization</head><p>Cascaded flow inference resembles the role of data fidelity in conventional minimization methods. Using data term alone, vague flow boundaries and undesired artifacts commonly exist in flow field <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. To tackle this problem, we propose to use a feature-driven local convolution (f-lcon) to regularize flow field from the cascaded flow inference. The operation of f-lcon is well-governed by the Laplacian formulation of diffusion of pixel values <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>. In contrast to local convolution (lcon) used in conventional CNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, f-lcon is more generalized. Not only is a distinct filter used for each position of feature map, but the filter is adaptively constructed for individual flow patches.</p><p>Consider a general case, a vector-valued feature F that has to be regularized has C channels and a spatial dimension M × N . Define G = {g} as the set of filters used in f-lcon layer. The operation of f-lcon to F can be formulated as follow:</p><formula xml:id="formula_7">f g (x, y, c) = g(x, y, c) * f (x, y, c),<label>(5)</label></formula><p>where " * " denotes convolution, f (x, y, c) is a w × w patch centered at position (x, y) of channel c in F , g(x, y, c) is the corresponding w × w regularization filter, and f g (x, y, c) is a scalar output for x = (x, y) ⊤ and c = 1, 2, ..., C. To be specific for regularizing flow fieldẋ s from the cascaded flow inference, we replace F toẋ s . Flow regularization module R is defined as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">x r = R(ẋ s ; G).<label>(6)</label></formula><p>The f-lcon filters need to be specialized for smoothing flow field. It should behave as an averaging filter if the variation of flow vectors over the patch is smooth. It should also not over-smooth flow field across flow boundary. We define a feature-driven CNN distance metric D that estimates local flow variation using pyramidal feature F 1 , flow fieldẋ s from the cascaded flow inference, and occlusion probability map <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> O. In summary, D is adaptively constructed by a CNN unit R D as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">D = R D (F 1 ,ẋ s , O).<label>(7)</label></formula><p>With the introduction of feature-driven distance metric D, each filter g of f-lcon is constructed as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">g(x, y, c) = exp(−D(x, y, c) 2 ) (xi,yi)∈N (x,y) exp(−D(x i , y i , c) 2 ) ,<label>(8)</label></formula><p>where N (x, y) denotes the neighborhood containing ω × ω pixels centered at position (x, y).</p><p>Here, we provide a mechanism to perform f-lcon efficiently. For a C-channel input F , we use C tensors G(1), ...,Ḡ(C) to store f-lcon filter set G. As illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref>, each f-lcon filter g(x, y, c) is folded into a 1 × 1 × w 2 3D column and then packed into the (x, y)-entry of a M × N × w 2 3D tensorḠ(c). Same folding and packing operations are also applied to each patch in each channel of F . This results C tensorsF (1), ...,F (C) for F . In this way, Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_7">(5)</ref> can be reformulated to:</p><formula xml:id="formula_11">F g (c) =Ḡ(c) ⊙F (c),<label>(9)</label></formula><p>where "⊙" denotes element-wise dot product between the corresponding columns of the tensors. With the abuse of notation, F g (c) means the c-th xy-slice of the regularized C-channel feature F g . Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_11">(9)</ref> reduces the dimension of tensors from M × N × w 2 (right-hand side in prior to the dot product) to M × N (left-hand side).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Experiments</head><p>Network Details. In LiteFlowNet, NetC generates 6-level pyramidal features and NetE predicts flow fields for levels 6 to 2. Flow field in level 2 is upsampled to yield flow field in level 1. We set the maximum searching radius in costvolume to 3 pixels (levels 6 to 4) or 6 pixels (levels 3 to 2). Matching is performed at each position in pyramidal features, except for levels 3 to 2 that it is performed at a regularly sampled grid (a stride of 2). All convolution layers use 3 × 3 filters, except each last layer in descriptor matching M , sub-pixel refinement S, and flow regularization R units uses 5×5 (levels 4 to 3) or 7×7 (level 2) filters. Each convolution layer is followed by a leaky rectified linear unit layer, except f-lcon and the last layer in M , S and R CNN units. More details can be found in the supplementary material.</p><p>Training Details. We train our network stage-wise by the following steps: 1) NetC and M 6 :S 6 of NetE is trained for 300k iterations. 2) R 6 together with the trained network in step 1 is trained for 300k iterations. 3) For levels k ∈ [5, 2], M k :S k followed by R k is added into the trained network each time. The new network cascade is trained for 200k (level 2: 300k) iterations. Filter weights are initialized from previous level. Learning rates are initially set to 1e-4, 5e-5, and 4e-5 for levels 6 to 4, 3 and 2 respectively. We reduce it by a factor of 2 starting at 120k, 160k, 200k, and 240k iterations. We use the same L2 training loss, Adam optimization, data augmentation, and training schedule (Chairs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> → Things3D <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>) as FlowNet2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.

In <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, LiteFlowNetX-pre outperforms FlowNetS (and C) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and SPyNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> that are trained on Chairs on all cases except the Middlebury benchmark. LiteFlowNet, trained on the Chairs → Things3D schedule, performs better than LiteFlowNet-pre as expected.

As in the case for Sintel, LiteFlowNetft and FlowNet2-ft-kitti performs the best among the compared methods. Even though LiteFlowNet and its variants perform pyramidal descriptor matching in a limited searching range, it yields reliable large-displacement flow fields for real-world data due to the feature warping (f-warp) layer introduced.

We consider two variants LiteFlowNetpre (WM and WMS) and compare them to the counterparts with warping disabled (M and MS). Flow fields from M and MS are more vague. Large degradation in AEE is noticed especially for KITTI12 (33%) and KITTI15 (25%). With feature warping, pyramidal features that input to flow inference are closer to each other. This facilitates flow estimation in subsequent pyramid level by computing residual flow.</p></div>

Descriptor Matching. We compare the variant WSR without descriptor matching for which the flow inference part is made as deep as that in the unamended LiteFlowNetpre (ALL). No noticeable difference between the flow fields from WSR and ALL. Since the maximum displacement of the example flow field is not very large (only 14.7 pixels), accurate flow field can still be yielded from WSR. For evaluation covering a wide range of flow displacement (especially large-displacement benchmark, KITTI), degradation in AEE is noticed for WSR. This suggests that descriptor matching is useful in addressing large-displacement flow. Sub-Pixel Refinement. The flow field generated from WMS is more crisp and contains more fine details than that generated from WM with sub-pixel refinement disabled. Less small-magnitude flow artifacts (represented by light color on the background) are also observed. Besides, WMS achieves smaller AEE. Since descriptor matching establishes pixel-by-pixel correspondence, sub-pixel refinement is necessary to yield detail-preserving flow field. Regularization. In comparison WMS with regularization disabled to ALL, undesired artifacts exist in homogeneous regions (represented by very dim color on the background) of the flow field generated from WMS. Flow bleeding and vague flow boundaries are observed. Degradation in AEE is also noticed. This suggests that the proposed feature-driven local convolution (f-lcon) plays the vital role to smooth flow field and maintain crisp flow boundaries as regularization term in conventional variational methods.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>We have presented a compact network for accurate flow estimation. LiteFlowNet outperforms FlowNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and is on par with the state-of-the-art FlowNet2 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> on public benchmarks while being faster in runtime and 30 times smaller in model size. Pyramidal feature extraction and feature warping (f-warp) help us to break the de facto rule of accurate flow network requiring large model size. To address large-displacement and detail-preserving flows, LiteFlowNet exploits short-range matching to generate pixellevel flow field and further improves the estimate to subpixel accuracy in the cascaded flow inference. To result crisp flow boundaries, LiteFlowNet regularizes flow field through feature-driven local convolution (f-lcon). With its lightweight, accurate, and fast flow computation, we expect that LiteFlowNet can be deployed to many applications such as motion segmentation, action recognition, and more.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Figure 1: Examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed components in LiteFlowNet for i) feature warping, ii) cascaded flow inference, and iii) flow regularization.

NetE yields multi-scale flow fields that each of them is generated by a cascaded flow inference module M :S (in blue color, including a descriptor matching unit M and a sub-pixel refinement unit S) and a regularization module R (in green color).
