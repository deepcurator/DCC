<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>One of the fundamental challenges of computer vision is to draw inferences about the three-dimensional (3D) world from two-dimensional (2D) images. Since one seldom has access to 3D object models, one must usually learn to recognize and reason about 3D objects based upon their 2D appearances from various viewpoints. Thus, computer vision researchers have typically developed object recognition algorithms from 2D features of 2D images, and used them to classify new 2D pictures of those objects.</p><p>But what if one does have access to 3D models of each object of interest? In this case, one can directly train recognition algorithms on 3D features such as voxel occupancy or surface curvature. The possibility of building such classifiers of 3D shapes directly from 3D representations has recently emerged due to the introduction of large 3D shape repositories, such as 3D Warehouse, TurboSquid, and Shapeways. For example, when Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> introduced the ModelNet 3D shape database, they presented a classifier for 3D shapes using a deep belief network architecture trained on voxel representations.</p><p>While intuitively, it seems logical to build 3D shape classifiers directly from 3D models, in this paper we present a seemingly counterintuitive result -that by building classifiers of 3D shapes from 2D image renderings of those shapes, we can actually dramatically outperform the classifiers built directly on the 3D representations. In particular, a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained on a fixed set of rendered views of a 3D shape and only provided with a single view at test time increases category recognition accuracy by a remarkable 8% (77% → 85%) over the best models <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> trained on 3D representations. With more views provided at test time, its performance further increases.</p><p>One reason for this result is the relative efficiency of the 2D versus the 3D representations. In particular, while a full resolution 3D representation contains all of the information about an object, in order to use a voxel-based representation in a deep network that can be trained with available samples and in a reasonable amount of time, it would appear that the resolution needs to be significantly reduced. For example, 3D ShapeNets use a coarse representation of shape, a 30×30×30 grid of binary voxels. In contrast a single projection of the 3D model of the same input size corresponds to an image of 164×164 pixels, or slightly smaller if multiple projections are used. Indeed, there is an inherent trade-off between increasing the amount of explicit depth information (3D models) and increasing spatial resolution (projected 2D models).</p><p>Another advantage of using 2D representations is that we can leverage (i) advances in image descriptors <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> and (ii) massive image databases (such as ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>) to pre-train our CNN architectures. Because images are ubiquitous and large labeled datasets are abundant, we can learn a good deal about generic features for 2D image categorization and then fine-tune to specifics about 3D model projections. While it is possible that some day as much 3D  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Multi-view CNN for 3D shape recognition (illustrated using the 1 st camera setup). At test time a 3D shape is rendered from 12 different views and are passed thorough CNN1 to extract view based features. These are then pooled across views and passed through CNN2 to obtain a compact shape descriptor. training data will be available, for the time being this is a significant advantage of our representation.</p><p>Although the simple strategy of classifying views independently works remarkably well (Sect. 3.2), we present new ideas for how to "compile" the information in multiple 2D views of an object into a compact object descriptor using a new architecture called multi-view CNN ( <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref> and Sect. 3.3). This descriptor is at least as informative for classification (and for retrieval is slightly more informative) than the full collection of view-based descriptors of the object. Moreover it facilitates efficient retrieval using either a similar 3D object or a simple hand-drawn sketch, without resorting to slower methods that are based on pairwise comparisons of image descriptors. We present state-of-the-art results on 3D object classification, 3D object retrieval using 3D objects, and 3D object retrieval using sketches (Sect. 4).</p><p>Our multi-view CNN is related to "jittering" where transformed copies of the data are added during training to learn invariances to transformations such as rotation or translation. In the context of 3D recognition the views can be seen as jittered copies. The multi-view CNN learns to combine the views instead of averaging, and thus can use the more informative views of the object for prediction while ignoring others. Our experiments show that this improves performance (Sect. 4.1) and also lets us visualize informative views of the object by back-propagating the gradients of the network to the views <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">(Fig. 3)</ref>. Even on traditional image classification tasks multi-view CNN can be a better alternative to jittering. For example, on the sketch recognition benchmark <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> a multi-view CNN trained on jittered copies performs better than a standard CNN trained with the same jittered copies (Sect. 4.2).</p><p>Pre-trained CNN models, data, and the complete source code to reproduce the results in the paper are available at http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/mvcnn.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Related Work</head><p>Our method is related to prior work on shape descriptors for 3D objects and image-based CNNs. Next we discuss representative work in these areas.</p><p>Shape descriptors. A large corpus of shape descriptors has been developed for drawing inferences about 3D objects in both the computer vision and graphics literature. Shape descriptors can be classified into two broad categories: 3D shape descriptors that directly work on the native 3D representations of objects, such as polygon meshes, voxel-based discretizations, point clouds, or implicit surfaces, and viewbased descriptors that describe the shape of a 3D object by "how it looks" in a collection of 2D projections.</p><p>With the exception of the recent work of Wu et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> which learns shape descriptors from the voxel-based representation of an object through 3D convolutional nets, previous 3D shape descriptors were largely "hand-designed" according to a particular geometric property of the shape surface or volume. For example, shapes can be represented with histograms or bag-of-features models constructed out of surface normals and curvatures <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, distances, angles, triangle areas or tetrahedra volumes gathered at sampled surface points <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, properties of spherical functions defined in volumetric grids <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, local shape diameters measured at densely sampled surface points <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, heat kernel signatures on polygon meshes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, or extensions of the SIFT and SURF feature descriptors to 3D voxel grids <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>. Developing classifiers and other supervised machine learning algorithms on top of such 3D shape descriptors poses a number of challenges. First, the size of organized databases with annotated 3D models is rather limited compared to image datasets, e.g., ModelNet contains about 150K shapes (its 40 category benchmark contains about 4K shapes). In contrast, the ImageNet database <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> already includes tens of millions of annotated images. Second, 3D shape descriptors tend to be very high-dimensional, making classifiers prone to overfitting due to the so-called 'curse of dimensionality'.</p><p>On the other hand view-based descriptors have a number of desirable properties: they are relatively low-dimensional, efficient to evaluate, and robust to 3D shape representation artifacts, such as holes, imperfect polygon mesh tesselations, noisy surfaces. The rendered shape views can also be directly compared with other 2D images, silhouettes or even hand-drawn sketches. An early example of a view-based approach is the work by Murase and Nayar <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> that recognizes objects by matching their appearance in parametric eigenspaces formed by large sets of 2D renderings of 3D models under varying poses and illuminations. Another example, which is particularly popular in computer graphics setups, is the LightField descriptor <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> that extracts a set of geometric and Fourier descriptors from object silhouettes rendered from several different viewpoints. Alternatively, the silhouette of an object can be decomposed into parts and then represented by a directed acyclic graph (shock graph) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>. Cyr and Kimia <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> defined similarity metrics based on curve matching and grouped similar views, called aspect graphs of 3D models <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>. Eitz et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> compared human sketches with line drawings of 3D models produced from several different views based on local Gabor filters, while Schneider et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> proposed using Fisher vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> on SIFT features <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> for representing human sketches of shapes. These descriptors are largely "hand-engineered" and some do not generalize well across different domains.</p><p>Convolutional neural networks. Our work is also related to recent advances in image recognition using CNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>. In particular CNNs trained on the large datasets such as ImageNet have been shown to learn general purpose image descriptors for a number of vision tasks such as object detection, scene recognition, texture recognition and finegrained classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>. We show that these deep architectures can be adapted to specific domains including shaded illustrations of 3D objects, line drawings, and human sketches to produce descriptors that have superior performance compared to other view-based or 3D shape descriptors in a variety of setups. Furthermore, they are compact and efficient to compute. There has been existing work on recognizing 3D objects with CNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> using two concatenated views (binocular images) as input. Our network instead learns a shape representation that aggregates information from any number of input views without any specific ordering, and always outputs a compact shape descriptor of the same size. Furthermore, we leverage both image and shape datasets to train our network.</p><p>Although there is significant work on 3D and 2D shape descriptors, and estimating informative views of the objects (or, aspect graphs), there is relatively little work on learning to combine the view-based descriptors for 3D shape recognition. Most methods resort to simple strategies such as performing exhaustive pairwise comparisons of descriptors extracted from different views of each shape, or concatenating descriptors from ordered, consistent views. In contrast our multi-view CNN architecture learns to recognize 3D shapes from views of the shapes using image-based CNNs but in the context of other views via a view-pooling layer. As a result, information from multiple views is effectively accumulated into a single, compact shape descriptor.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Method</head><p>As discussed above, our focus in this paper is on developing view-based descriptors for 3D shapes that are trainable, produce informative representations for recognition and retrieval tasks, and are efficient to compute.</p><p>Our view-based representations start from multiple views of a 3D shape, generated by a rendering engine. A simple way to use multiple views is to generate a 2D image descriptor per each view, and then use the individual descriptors directly for recognition tasks based on some voting or alignment scheme. For example, a naïve approach would be to average the individual descriptors, treating all the views as equally important. Alternatively, if the views are rendered in a reproducible order, one could also concatenate the 2D descriptors of all the views. Unfortunately, aligning a 3D shape to a canonical orientation is hard and sometimes ill-defined. In contrast to the above simple approaches, an aggregated representation combining features from multiple views is more desirable since it yields a single, compact descriptor representing the 3D shape.</p><p>Our approach is to learn to combine information from multiple views using a unified CNN architecture that includes a view-pooling layer <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. All the parameters of our CNN architecture are learned discriminatively to produce a single compact descriptor for the 3D shape. Compared to exhaustive pairwise comparisons between singleview representations of 3D shapes, our resulting descriptors can be directly used to compare 3D shapes leading to significantly higher computational efficiency.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Input: A Multi-view Representation</head><p>3D models in online databases are typically stored as polygon meshes, which are collections of points connected with edges forming faces. To generate rendered views of polygon meshes, we use the Phong reflection model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>. The mesh polygons are rendered under a perspective projection and the pixel color is determined by interpolating the reflected intensity of the polygon vertices. Shapes are uniformly scaled to fit into the viewing volume.</p><p>To create a multi-view shape representation, we need to setup viewpoints (virtual cameras) for rendering each mesh.</p><p>We experimented with two camera setups. For the 1 st camera setup, we assume that the input shapes are upright oriented along a consistent axis (e.g., z-axis). Most models in modern online repositories, such as the 3D Warehouse, satisfy this requirement, and some previous recognition methods also follow the same assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>. In this case, we create 12 rendered views by placing 12 virtual cameras around the mesh every 30 degrees (see <ref type="figure">Fig. 1</ref>). The cameras are elevated 30 degrees from the ground plane, pointing towards the centroid of the mesh. The centroid is calculated as the weighted average of the mesh face centers, where the weights are the face areas. For the 2 nd camera setup, we do not make use of the assumption about consistent upright orientation of shapes. In this case, we render from several more viewpoints since we do not know beforehand which ones yield good representative views of the object. The renderings are generated by placing 20 virtual cameras at the 20 vertices of an icosahedron enclosing the shape. All cameras point towards the centroid of the mesh. Then we generate 4 rendered views from each camera, using 0, 90, 180, 270 degrees rotation along the axis passing through the camera and the object centroid, yielding total 80 views.</p><p>We note that using different shading coefficients or illumination models did not affect our output descriptors due to the invariance of the learned filters to illumination changes, as also observed in image-based CNNs <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>. Adding more or different viewpoints is trivial, however, we found that the above camera setups were already enough to achieve high performance. Finally, rendering each mesh from all the viewpoints takes no more than ten milliseconds on modern graphics hardware.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Recognition with Multi-view Representations</head><p>We claim that our multi-view representation contains rich information about 3D shapes and can be applied to various types of tasks. In the first setting, we make use of existing 2D image features directly and produce a descriptor for each view. This is the most straightforward approach to utilize the multi-view representation. However, it results in multiple 2D image descriptors per 3D shape, one per view, which need to be integrated somehow for recognition tasks.</p><p>Image descriptors. We consider two types of image descriptors for each 2D view: a state-of-the-art "hand-crafted" image descriptor based on Fisher vectors <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> with multiscale SIFT, as well as CNN activation features <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</p><p>The Fisher vector image descriptor is implemented using VLFeat <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>. For each image multi-scale SIFT descriptors are extracted densely. These are then projected to 80 dimensions with PCA, followed by Fisher vector pooling with a Gaussian mixture model with 64 components, square-root and ℓ 2 normalization.</p><p>For our CNN features we use the VGG-M network from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> which consists of mainly five convolutional layers conv 1,...,5 followed by three fully connected layers fc 6,..., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> and a softmax classification layer. The penultimate layer fc 7 (after ReLU non-linearity, 4096-dimensional) is used as image descriptor. The network is pre-trained on ImageNet images from 1k categories, and then fine-tuned on all 2D views of the 3D shapes in training set. As we show in our experiments, fine-tuning improves performance significantly. Both Fisher vectors and CNN features yield very good performance in classification and retrieval compared with popular 3D shape descriptors (e.g., SPH <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, LFD <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>) as well as 3D ShapeNets <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</p><p>Classification. We train one-vs-rest linear SVMs (each view is treated as a separate training sample) to classify shapes using their image features. At test time, we simply sum up the SVM decision values over all 12 views and return the class with the highest sum. Alternative approaches, e.g., averaging image descriptors, lead to worse accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>Retrieval.</head><p>A distance or similarity measure is required for retrieval tasks. For shape x with n x image descriptors and shape y with n y image descriptors, the distance between them is defined in Eq. 1. Note that the distance between two 2D images is defined as the ℓ 2 distance between their feature vectors, i.e.</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">x i − y j 2 . d(x, y) = j min i x i − y j 2 2n y + i min j x i − y j 2 2n x<label>(1)</label></formula><p>To interpret this definition, we can first define the distance between a 2D image x i and a 3D shape y as d(x i , y) = min j x i − y j 2 . Then given all n x distances between x's 2D projections and y, the distance between these two shapes is computed by simple averaging. In Eq. 1, this idea is applied in both directions to ensure symmetry.</p><p>We investigated alternative distance measures, such as minimun distance among all n x · n y image pairs and the distance between average image descriptors, but they all led to inferior performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3.">Multi-view CNN: Learning to Aggregate Views</head><p>Although having multiple separate descriptors for each 3D shape can be successful for classification and retrieval compared to existing 3D descriptors, it can be inconvenient and inefficient in many cases. For example, in Eq. 1, we need to compute all n x ×n y pairwise distances between images in order to compute distance between two 3D shapes. Simply averaging or concatenating the image descriptors leads to inferior performance. In this section, we focus on the problem of learning to aggregate multiple views in order to synthesize the information from all views into a single, compact 3D shape descriptor.</p><p>We design the multi-view CNN (MVCNN) on top of image-based CNNs <ref type="figure">(Fig. 1)</ref>. Each image in a 3D shape's multi-view representation is passed through the first part of the network (CNN 1 ) separately, aggregated at a viewpooling layer, and then sent through the remaining part of the network (CNN 2 ). All branches in the first part of the network share the same parameters in CNN 1 . We use element-wise maximum operation across the views in the view-pooling layer. An alternative is element-wise mean operation, but it is not as effective in our experiments. The view-pooling layer can be placed anywhere in the network. We show in our experiments that it should be placed close to the last convolutional layer (conv 5 ) for optimal classification and retrieval performance. View-pooling layers are closely related to max-pooling layers and maxout layers <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, with the only difference being the dimension that their pooling operations are carried out on. The MVCNN is a directed acyclic graphs and can be trained or fine-tuned using stochastic gradient descent with back-propagation.</p><p>Using fc 7 (after ReLU non-linearity) in an MVCNN as an aggregated shape descriptor, we achieve higher performance than using separate image descriptors from an image-based CNN directly, especially in retrieval (62.8% → 70.1%). Perhaps more importantly, the aggregated descriptor is readily available for a variety of tasks, e.g., shape classification and retrieval, and offers significant speed-ups against multiple image descriptors.</p><p>An MVCNN can also be used as a general framework to integrate perturbed image samples (also known as data jittering). We illustrate this capability of MVCNNs in the context of sketch recognition in Sect. 4.2.</p><p>Low-rank Mahalanobis metric. Our MVCNN is finetuned for classification, and thus retrieval performance is not directly optimized. Although we could train it with a different objective function suitable for retrieval, we found that a simpler approach can readily yield a significant retrieval performance boost (see row 12 in Tab. 1). We learn a Mahalanobis metric W that directly projects MVCNN descriptors φ ∈ R d to W φ ∈ R p , such that the ℓ 2 distances in the projected space are small between shapes of the same category, and large otherwise. We use the large-margin metric learning algorithm and implementation from <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, with p &lt; d to make the final descriptor compact (p = 128 in our experiments). The fact that we can readily use metric learning over the output shape descriptor demonstrates another advantage of using MVCNNs.</p></div>

When all 12 views of the shape are available at test time (based on our first camera setup), we can also average the predictions over these views.

Similarly, retrieval mAP is improved by 21.2% (49.2% → 70.4%).

Here we show that this is indeed the case by exploring its connection with data jittering in the context of sketch recognition.</p><p>Data jittering, or data augmentation, is a method to generate extra samples from a given image. It is the process of perturbing the image by transformations that change its appearance while leaving the high-level information (class  label, attributes, etc.) intact. Jittering can be applied at training time to augment training samples and to reduce overfitting, or at test time to provide more robust predictions. In particular, several authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> have used data jittering to improve the performance of deep representations on 2D image classification tasks. In these applications, jittering at training time usually includes random image translations (implemented as random crops), horizontal reflections, and color perturbations. At test time jittering usually only includes a few crops (e.g., four at the corners, one at the center and their horizontal reflections). We now examine whether we can get more benefit out of jittered views of an image by using the same feature aggregation scheme we developed for recognizing 3D shapes. The human sketch dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> contains 20,000 handdrawn sketches of 250 object categories such as airplanes, apples, bridges, etc. The accuracy of humans in recognizing these hand-drawings is only 73% because of the low quality of some sketches. Schneider and Tuytelaars <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> cleaned up the dataset by removing instances and categories that humans find hard to recognize. This cleaned dataset (SketchClean) contains 160 categories, on which humans can achieve 93% recognition accuracy. Using SIFT Fisher vectors with spatial pyramid pooling and linear SVMs, Schneider and Tuytelaars achieved 68.9% recognition accuracy on the original dataset and 79.0% on the SketchClean dataset. We split the SketchClean dataset randomly into training, validation and test set, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> and report classification accuracy on the test set in Tab. 2.</p><p>With an off-the-shelf CNN (VGG-M from <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>), we are able to get 77.3% classification accuracy without any network fine-tuning. With fine-tuning on the training set, the accuracy can be further improved to 84.0%, significantly surpassing the Fisher vector approach. These numbers are <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> The dataset does not come with a standard training/val/test split.</p><p>achieved by using the penultimate layer (fc 7 ) in the network as image descriptors and linear SVMs.</p><p>Although it is impractical to get multiple views from 2D images, we can use jittering to mimic the effect of views. For each hand-drawn sketch, we do in-plane rotation with three angles: −45°, 0°, 45°, and also horizontal reflections (hence 6 samples per image). We apply the two CNN variants (regular CNN and MVCNN) discussed earlier for aggregating multiple views of 3D shapes, and get 85.5% (CNN w/o view-pooling) and 86.3% (MVCNN w/ viewpooling on fc 7 ) classification accuracy respectively. The latter also has the advantage of a single, more compact descriptor for each hand-drawn sketch.</p><p>With a deeper network architecture (VGG-VD, a network with 16 weight layers from <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>), we achieve 87.2% accuracy, further advancing the classification performance, and closely approaching human performance.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.3.">Sketch-based 3D Shape Retrieval</head><p>Due to the growing number of online 3D repositories, many approaches have been investigated to perform efficient 3D shape retrieval. Most online repositories (e.g. 3D Warehouse, TurboSquid, Shapeways) provide only textbased search engines or hierarchical catalogs for 3D shape retrieval. However, it is hard to convey stylistic and geometric variations using only textual descriptions, thus sketchbased shape retrieval <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref> has been proposed as an alternative for users to retrieve shapes with an approximate sketch of the desired 3D shape in mind. Sketchbased retrieval is challenging since it involves two heterogeneous data domains (hand-drawn sketches and 3D shapes), and sketches can be highly abstract and visually different from target 3D shapes. Here we demonstrate the potential strength of MVCNNs in sketch-based shape retrieval.</p><p>For this experiment, we construct a dataset containing   193 sketches and 790 CAD models from 10 categories existing in both SketchClean and ModelNet40. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, we produce renderings of 3D shapes with a style similar to hand-drawn sketches (see <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">Fig. 4</ref>). This is achieved by detecting Canny edges on the depth buffer (also known as z-buffer) from 12 viewpoints. These edge maps are then passed through CNNs to obtain image descriptors. Descriptors are also extracted from 6 perturbed samples of each query sketch in the manner described in Sect. 4.2. Finally we rank 3D shapes w.r.t. "average minimum distance" (Eq. 1) to the sketch descriptors. Representative retrieval results are shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Fig. 5</ref>. We are able to retrieve 3D objects from the same class with the query sketch, as well as being visually similar, especially in the top few matches. Our performance is 36.1% mAP on this dataset. Here we use the VGG-M network trained on ImageNet without any fine-tuning on either sketches or 3D shapes. With a fine-tuning procedure that optimizes a distance measure between hand-drawn sketches and 3D shapes, e.g., by using a Siamese Network <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, retrieval performance can be further improved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Conclusion</head><p>While the world is full of 3D shapes, as humans at least, we understand that world is mostly through 2D images. We have shown that using images of shapes as inputs to modern learning architectures, we can achieve performance better than any previously published results, including those that operate on direct 3D representations of shapes. While even a näive usage of these multiple 2D projections yields impressive discrimination performance, by building descriptors that are aggregations of information from multiple views, we can achieve compactness, efficiency, and better accuracy. In addition, by relating the content of 3D shapes to 2D representations like sketches, we can retrieve these 3D shapes at high accuracy using sketches, and leverage the implicit knowledge of 3D shapes contained in their 2D views.</p><p>There are a number of directions to explore in future work. One is to experiment with different combinations of 2D views. Which views are most informative? How many views are necessary for a given level of accuracy? Can informative views be selected on the fly?</p><p>Another obvious question is whether our view aggregating techniques can be used for building compact and discriminative descriptors for real-world 3D objects from multiple views, or automatically from video, rather than merely for 3D polygon mesh models. Such investigations could be immediately applicable to widely studied problems such as object recognition and face recognition.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 2 .</head><label>2</label><figDesc>Figure 2.
