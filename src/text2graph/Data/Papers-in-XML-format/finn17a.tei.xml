The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples.

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1.">Introduction</head><p>Learning quickly is a hallmark of human intelligence, whether it involves recognizing objects from a few examples or quickly learning new skills after just minutes of experience. Our artificial agents should be able to do the same, learning and adapting quickly from only a few examples, and continuing to adapt as more data becomes available. This kind of fast and flexible learning is challenging, since the agent must integrate its prior experience with a small amount of new information, while avoiding overfitting to the new data. Furthermore, the form of prior experience and new data will depend on the task. As such, for the greatest applicability, the mechanism for learning to learn (or meta-learning) should be general to the task and 1 University of California, Berkeley 2 OpenAI.

Copyright 2017</ref> by the author(s). the form of computation required to complete the task.</p><p>In this work, we propose a meta-learning algorithm that is general and model-agnostic, in the sense that it can be directly applied to any learning problem and model that is trained with a gradient descent procedure. Our focus is on deep neural network models, but we illustrate how our approach can easily handle different architectures and different problem settings, including classification, regression, and policy gradient reinforcement learning, with minimal modification. In meta-learning, the goal of the trained model is to quickly learn a new task from a small amount of new data, and the model is trained by the meta-learner to be able to learn on a large number of different tasks. The key idea underlying our method is to train the model's initial parameters such that the model has maximal performance on a new task after the parameters have been updated through one or more gradient steps computed with a small amount of data from that new task. Unlike prior meta-learning methods that learn an update function or learning rule <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Schmidhuber, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bengio et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andrychowicz et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ravi &amp; Larochelle, 2017)</ref>, our algorithm does not expand the number of learned parameters nor place constraints on the model architecture (e.g. by requiring a recurrent model <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Santoro et al., 2016)</ref> or a Siamese network <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Koch, 2015)</ref>), and it can be readily combined with fully connected, convolutional, or recurrent neural networks. It can also be used with a variety of loss functions, including differentiable supervised losses and nondifferentiable reinforcement learning objectives.</p><p>The process of training a model's parameters such that a few gradient steps, or even a single gradient step, can produce good results on a new task can be viewed from a feature learning standpoint as building an internal representation that is broadly suitable for many tasks. If the internal representation is suitable to many tasks, simply fine-tuning the parameters slightly (e.g. by primarily modifying the top layer weights in a feedforward model) can produce good results. In effect, our procedure optimizes for models that are easy and fast to fine-tune, allowing the adaptation to happen in the right space for fast learning. From a dynamical systems standpoint, our learning process can be viewed as maximizing the sensitivity of the loss functions of new tasks with respect to the parameters: when the sensitivity is high, small local changes to the parameters can lead to large improvements in the task loss.</p><p>The primary contribution of this work is a simple modeland task-agnostic algorithm for meta-learning that trains a model's parameters such that a small number of gradient updates will lead to fast learning on a new task. We demonstrate the algorithm on different model types, including fully connected and convolutional networks, and in several distinct domains, including few-shot regression, image classification, and reinforcement learning. Our evaluation shows that our meta-learning algorithm compares favorably to state-of-the-art one-shot learning methods designed specifically for supervised classification, while using fewer parameters, but that it can also be readily applied to regression and can accelerate reinforcement learning in the presence of task variability, substantially outperforming direct pretraining as initialization.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.">Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning</head><p>We aim to train models that can achieve rapid adaptation, a problem setting that is often formalized as few-shot learning. In this section, we will define the problem setup and present the general form of our algorithm.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1.">Meta-Learning Problem Set-Up</head><p>The goal of few-shot meta-learning is to train a model that can quickly adapt to a new task using only a few datapoints and training iterations. To accomplish this, the model or learner is trained during a meta-learning phase on a set of tasks, such that the trained model can quickly adapt to new tasks using only a small number of examples or trials. In effect, the meta-learning problem treats entire tasks as training examples. In this section, we formalize this metalearning problem setting in a general manner, including brief examples of different learning domains. We will discuss two different learning domains in detail in Section 3. We consider a model, denoted f , that maps observations x to outputs a. During meta-learning, the model is trained to be able to adapt to a large or infinite number of tasks. Since we would like to apply our framework to a variety of learning problems, from classification to reinforcement learning, we introduce a generic notion of a learning task below. Formally, each task T = {L(x 1 , a 1 , . . . , x H , a H ), q(x 1 ), q(x t+1 |x t , a t ), H} consists of a loss function L, a distribution over initial observations q(x 1 ), a transition distribution q(x t+1 |x t , a t ), and an episode length H. In i.i.d. supervised learning problems, the length H = 1. The model may generate samples of length H by choosing an output a t at each time t. The loss L(x 1 , a 1 , . . . , x H , a H ) → R, provides task-specific feedback, which might be in the form of a misclassification loss or a cost function in a Markov decision process.  <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>. Diagram of our model-agnostic meta-learning algorithm (MAML), which optimizes for a representation θ that can quickly adapt to new tasks.</p><p>In our meta-learning scenario, we consider a distribution over tasks p(T ) that we want our model to be able to adapt to. In the K-shot learning setting, the model is trained to learn a new task T i drawn from p(T ) from only K samples drawn from q i and feedback L Ti generated by T i . During meta-training, a task T i is sampled from p(T ), the model is trained with K samples and feedback from the corresponding loss L Ti from T i , and then tested on new samples from T i . The model f is then improved by considering how the test error on new data from q i changes with respect to the parameters. In effect, the test error on sampled tasks T i serves as the training error of the meta-learning process. At the end of meta-training, new tasks are sampled from p(T ), and meta-performance is measured by the model's performance after learning from K samples. Generally, tasks used for meta-testing are held out during meta-training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2.">A Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning Algorithm</head><p>In contrast to prior work, which has sought to train recurrent neural networks that ingest entire datasets <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Santoro et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Duan et al., 2016b)</ref> or feature embeddings that can be combined with nonparametric methods at test time <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Vinyals et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Koch, 2015)</ref>, we propose a method that can learn the parameters of any standard model via meta-learning in such a way as to prepare that model for fast adaptation. The intuition behind this approach is that some internal representations are more transferrable than others. For example, a neural network might learn internal features that are broadly applicable to all tasks in p(T ), rather than a single individual task. How can we encourage the emergence of such general-purpose representations? We take an explicit approach to this problem: since the model will be fine-tuned using a gradient-based learning rule on a new task, we will aim to learn a model in such a way that this gradient-based learning rule can make rapid progress on new tasks drawn from p(T ), without overfitting. In effect, we will aim to find model parameters that are sensitive to changes in the task, such that small changes in the parameters will produce large improvements on the loss function of any task drawn from p(T ), when altered in the direction of the gradient of that loss (see <ref type="figure">Figure 1</ref>). We Compute adapted parameters with gradient descent:</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">θ i = θ − α∇ θ L Ti (f θ ) 7:</formula><p>end for 8:</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">Update θ ← θ − β∇ θ Ti∼p(T ) L Ti (f θ i ) 9:</formula><p>end while make no assumption on the form of the model, other than to assume that it is parametrized by some parameter vector θ, and that the loss function is smooth enough in θ that we can use gradient-based learning techniques.</p><p>Formally, we consider a model represented by a parametrized function f θ with parameters θ. When adapting to a new task T i , the model's parameters θ become θ i . In our method, the updated parameter vector θ i is computed using one or more gradient descent updates on task T i . For example, when using one gradient update,</p><formula xml:id="formula_2">θ i = θ − α∇ θ L Ti (f θ )</formula><p>. The step size α may be fixed as a hyperparameter or metalearned. For simplicity of notation, we will consider one gradient update for the rest of this section, but using multiple gradient updates is a straightforward extension.</p><p>The model parameters are trained by optimizing for the performance of f θ i with respect to θ across tasks sampled from p(T ). More concretely, the meta-objective is as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_3">min θ Ti∼p(T ) L Ti (f θ i ) = Ti∼p(T ) L Ti (f θ−α∇ θ L T i (f θ ) )</formula><p>Note that the meta-optimization is performed over the model parameters θ, whereas the objective is computed using the updated model parameters θ . In effect, our proposed method aims to optimize the model parameters such that one or a small number of gradient steps on a new task will produce maximally effective behavior on that task.</p><p>The meta-optimization across tasks is performed via stochastic gradient descent (SGD), such that the model parameters θ are updated as follows:</p><formula xml:id="formula_4">θ ← θ − β∇ θ Ti∼p(T ) L Ti (f θ i ) (1)</formula><p>where β is the meta step size. The full algorithm, in the general case, is outlined in Algorithm 1.</p><p>The MAML meta-gradient update involves a gradient through a gradient. Computationally, this requires an additional backward pass through f to compute Hessian-vector products, which is supported by standard deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abadi et al., 2016)</ref>. In our experiments, we also include a comparison to dropping this backward pass and using a first-order approximation, which we discuss in Section 5.2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.">Species of MAML</head><p>In this section, we discuss specific instantiations of our meta-learning algorithm for supervised learning and reinforcement learning. The domains differ in the form of loss function and in how data is generated by the task and presented to the model, but the same basic adaptation mechanism can be applied in both cases.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1.">Supervised Regression and Classification</head><p>Few-shot learning is well-studied in the domain of supervised tasks, where the goal is to learn a new function from only a few input/output pairs for that task, using prior data from similar tasks for meta-learning. For example, the goal might be to classify images of a Segway after seeing only one or a few examples of a Segway, with a model that has previously seen many other types of objects. Likewise, in few-shot regression, the goal is to predict the outputs of a continuous-valued function from only a few datapoints sampled from that function, after training on many functions with similar statistical properties.</p><p>To formalize the supervised regression and classification problems in the context of the meta-learning definitions in Section 2.1, we can define the horizon H = 1 and drop the timestep subscript on x t , since the model accepts a single input and produces a single output, rather than a sequence of inputs and outputs. The task T i generates K i.i.d. observations x from q i , and the task loss is represented by the error between the model's output for x and the corresponding target values y for that observation and task.</p><p>Two common loss functions used for supervised classification and regression are cross-entropy and mean-squared error (MSE), which we will describe below; though, other supervised loss functions may be used as well. For regression tasks using mean-squared error, the loss takes the form:</p><formula xml:id="formula_5">L Ti (f φ ) = x (j) ,y (j) ∼Ti f φ (x (j) ) − y (j) 2 2 ,<label>(2)</label></formula><p>where x (j) , y (j) are an input/output pair sampled from task T i . In K-shot regression tasks, K input/output pairs are provided for learning for each task.</p><p>Similarly, for discrete classification tasks with a crossentropy loss, the loss takes the form: for all Ti do 5:</p><formula xml:id="formula_6">L Ti (f φ ) = x (j) ,y (j) ∼Ti y (j) log f φ (x (j) ) + (1 − y (j) ) log(1 − f φ (x (j) ))<label>(3)</label></formula><formula xml:id="formula_7">Sample K datapoints D = {x (j) , y (j) } from Ti 6:</formula><p>Evaluate ∇ θ LT i (f θ ) using D and LT i in Equation <ref type="formula" target="#formula_5">(2)</ref> or <ref type="formula" target="#formula_6">(3)  7:</ref> Compute adapted parameters with gradient descent:</p><formula xml:id="formula_8">θ i = θ − α∇ θ LT i (f θ ) 8:</formula><p>Sample datapoints D i = {x (j) , y (j) } from Ti for the meta-update 9:</p><p>end for 10:</p><p>Update</p><formula xml:id="formula_9">θ ← θ − β∇ θ T i ∼p(T ) LT i (f θ i ) using each D i</formula><p>and LT i in Equation 2 or 3 11: end while According to the conventional terminology, K-shot classification tasks use K input/output pairs from each class, for a total of N K data points for N -way classification. Given a distribution over tasks p(T i ), these loss functions can be directly inserted into the equations in Section 2.2 to perform meta-learning, as detailed in Algorithm 2.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2.">Reinforcement Learning</head><p>In reinforcement learning (RL), the goal of few-shot metalearning is to enable an agent to quickly acquire a policy for a new test task using only a small amount of experience in the test setting. A new task might involve achieving a new goal or succeeding on a previously trained goal in a new environment. For example, an agent might learn to quickly figure out how to navigate mazes so that, when faced with a new maze, it can determine how to reliably reach the exit with only a few samples. In this section, we will discuss how MAML can be applied to meta-learning for RL.</p><p>Each RL task T i contains an initial state distribution q i (x 1 ) and a transition distribution q i (x t+1 |x t , a t ), and the loss L Ti corresponds to the (negative) reward function R. The entire task is therefore a Markov decision process (MDP) with horizon H, where the learner is allowed to query a limited number of sample trajectories for few-shot learning. Any aspect of the MDP may change across tasks in p(T ). The model being learned, f θ , is a policy that maps from states x t to a distribution over actions a t at each timestep t ∈ {1, ..., H}. The loss for task T i and model f φ takes the form</p><formula xml:id="formula_10">L Ti (f φ ) = −E xt,at∼f φ ,q T i H t=1 R i (x t , a t ) . (4)</formula><p>In K-shot reinforcement learning, K rollouts from f θ and task T i , <ref type="figure">(x 1 , a 1 , .</ref>..x H ), and the corresponding rewards R(x t , a t ), may be used for adaptation on a new task T i .</p></div>

Since policy gradients are an on-policy algorithm, each additional gradient step during the adaptation of f θ requires new samples from the current policy f θ i . We detail the algorithm in Algorithm 3. This algorithm has the same structure as Algorithm 2, with the principal difference being that steps 5 and 8 require sampling trajectories from the environment corresponding to task T i . Practical implementations of this method may also use a variety of improvements recently proposed for policy gradient algorithms, including state or action-dependent baselines and trust regions <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Schulman et al., 2015)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.">Related Work</head><p>The method that we propose in this paper addresses the general problem of meta-learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Thrun &amp; Pratt, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">Schmidhuber, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Naik &amp; Mammone, 1992)</ref>, which includes few-shot learning. A popular approach for metalearning is to train a meta-learner that learns how to update the parameters of the learner's model <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bengio et al., 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Schmidhuber, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bengio et al., 1990)</ref>. This approach has been applied to learning to optimize deep networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Hochreiter et al., 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Andrychowicz et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Li &amp; Malik, 2017)</ref>, as well as for learning dynamically changing recurrent networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Ha et al., 2017)</ref>. One recent approach learns both the weight initialization and the optimizer, for few-shot image recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ravi &amp; Larochelle, 2017)</ref>. Unlike these methods, the MAML learner's weights are updated using the gradient, rather than a learned update; our method does not introduce additional parameters for meta-learning nor require a particular learner architecture.</p><p>Few-shot learning methods have also been developed for specific tasks such as generative modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Edwards &amp; Storkey, 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Rezende et al., 2016)</ref> and image recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Vinyals et al., 2016)</ref>. One successful approach for few-shot classification is to learn to compare new examples in a learned metric space using e.g. Siamese networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Koch, 2015)</ref> or recurrence with attention mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Vinyals et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Shyam et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Snell et al., 2017)</ref>. These approaches have generated some of the most successful results, but are difficult to directly extend to other problems, such as reinforcement learning. Our method, in contrast, is agnostic to the form of the model and to the particular learning task.</p><p>Another approach to meta-learning is to train memoryaugmented models on many tasks, where the recurrent learner is trained to adapt to new tasks as it is rolled out. Such networks have been applied to few-shot image recognition <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Santoro et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Munkhdalai &amp; Yu, 2017)</ref> and learning "fast" reinforcement learning agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Duan et al., 2016b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wang et al., 2016)</ref>. Our experiments show that our method outperforms the recurrent approach on fewshot classification. Furthermore, unlike these methods, our approach simply provides a good weight initialization and uses the same gradient descent update for both the learner and meta-update. As a result, it is straightforward to finetune the learner for additional gradient steps.</p><p>Our approach is also related to methods for initialization of deep networks. In computer vision, models pretrained on large-scale image classification have been shown to learn effective features for a range of problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Donahue et al., 2014)</ref>. In contrast, our method explicitly optimizes the model for fast adaptability, allowing it to adapt to new tasks with only a few examples. Our method can also be viewed as explicitly maximizing sensitivity of new task losses to the model parameters. A number of prior works have explored sensitivity in deep networks, often in the context of initialization <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Saxe et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Kirkpatrick et al., 2016)</ref>. Most of these works have considered good random initializations, though a number of papers have addressed datadependent initializers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Krähenbühl et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Salimans &amp; Kingma, 2016)</ref>, including learned initializations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(Husken &amp; Goerick, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Maclaurin et al., 2015)</ref>. In contrast, our method explicitly trains the parameters for sensitivity on a given task distribution, allowing for extremely efficient adaptation for problems such as K-shot learning and rapid reinforcement learning in only one or a few gradient steps.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.">Experimental Evaluation</head><p>The goal of our experimental evaluation is to answer the following questions: (1) Can MAML enable fast learning of new tasks? (2) Can MAML be used for meta-learning in multiple different domains, including supervised regression, classification, and reinforcement learning? (3) Can a model learned with MAML continue to improve with additional gradient updates and/or examples?</p><p>All of the meta-learning problems that we consider require some amount of adaptation to new tasks at test-time. When possible, we compare our results to an oracle that receives the identity of the task (which is a problem-dependent representation) as an additional input, as an upper bound on the performance of the model. All of the experiments were performed using TensorFlow <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abadi et al., 2016)</ref>, which allows for automatic differentiation through the gradient update(s) during meta-learning. The code is available online 1 .</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1.">Regression</head><p>We start with a simple regression problem that illustrates the basic principles of MAML.  <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kingma &amp; Ba, 2015)</ref>. The baselines are likewise trained with Adam. To evaluate performance, we finetune a single meta-learned model on varying numbers of K examples, and compare performance to two baselines: (a) pretraining on all of the tasks, which entails training a network to regress to random sinusoid functions and then, at test-time, fine-tuning with gradient descent on the K provided points, using an automatically tuned step size, and (b) an oracle which receives the true amplitude and phase as input. In Appendix C, we show comparisons to additional multi-task and adaptation methods.</p><p>We evaluate performance by fine-tuning the model learned by MAML and the pretrained model on K = {5, 10, 20} datapoints. During fine-tuning, each gradient step is computed using the same K datapoints. The qualitative results, shown in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> and further expanded on in Appendix B show that the learned model is able to quickly adapt with only 5 datapoints, shown as purple triangles, whereas the model that is pretrained using standard supervised learning on all tasks is unable to adequately adapt with so few datapoints without catastrophic overfitting. Crucially, when the K datapoints are all in one half of the input range, the  model trained with MAML can still infer the amplitude and phase in the other half of the range, demonstrating that the MAML trained model f has learned to model the periodic nature of the sine wave. Furthermore, we observe both in the qualitative and quantitative results <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">(Figure 3</ref> and Appendix B) that the model learned with MAML continues to improve with additional gradient steps, despite being trained for maximal performance after one gradient step. This improvement suggests that MAML optimizes the parameters such that they lie in a region that is amenable to fast adaptation and is sensitive to loss functions from p(T ), as discussed in Section 2.2, rather than overfitting to parameters θ that only improve after one step.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2.">Classification</head><p>To evaluate MAML in comparison to prior meta-learning and few-shot learning algorithms, we applied our method to few-shot image recognition on the Omniglot <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lake et al., 2011)</ref> and MiniImagenet datasets.

The Omniglot and MiniImagenet image recognition tasks are the most common recently used few-shot learning benchmarks <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Vinyals et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Santoro et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ravi &amp; Larochelle, 2017)</ref>.</p><p>We follow the experimental protocol proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Vinyals et al. (2016)</ref>, which involves fast learning of N -way classification with 1 or 5 shots. The problem of N -way classification is set up as follows: select N unseen classes, provide the model with K different instances of each of the N classes, and evaluate the model's ability to classify new instances within the N classes. For Omniglot, we randomly select 1200 characters for training, irrespective of alphabet, and use the remaining for testing. The Omniglot dataset is augmented with rotations by multiples of 90 degrees, as proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Santoro et al. (2016)</ref>.</p><p>Our model follows the same architecture as the embedding function used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Vinyals et al. (2016)</ref>, which has 4 modules with a 3 × 3 convolutions and 64 filters, followed by batch normalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ioffe &amp; Szegedy, 2015)</ref>, a ReLU nonlinearity, and 2 × 2 max-pooling. The Omniglot images are downsampled to 28 × 28, so the dimensionality of the last hidden layer is 64. As in the baseline classifier used by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Vinyals et al. (2016)</ref>, the last layer is fed into a softmax. For Omniglot, we used strided convolutions instead of max-pooling. For MiniImagenet, we used 32 filters per layer to reduce overfitting, as done by <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ravi &amp; Larochelle, 2017)</ref>. In order to also provide a fair comparison against memory-augmented neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Santoro et al., 2016)</ref> and to test the flexibility of MAML, we also provide results for a non-convolutional network. For this, we use a network with 4 hidden layers with sizes 256, 128, 64, 64, each including batch normalization and ReLU nonlinearities, followed by a linear layer and softmax. For all models, the loss function is the cross-entropy error between the predicted and true class. Additional hyperparameter details are included in Appendix A.1.</p><p>We present the results in <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">Table 1</ref>. The convolutional model learned by MAML compares well to the state-of-the-art results on this task, narrowly outperforming the prior methods. Some of these existing methods, such as matching networks, Siamese networks, and memory models are designed with few-shot classification in mind, and are not readily applicable to domains such as reinforcement learning. Additionally, the model learned with MAML uses  <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ravi &amp; Larochelle (2017)</ref>.</p><p>5-way Accuracy 20-way Accuracy Omniglot <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Lake et al., 2011)</ref> 1-shot 5-shot 1-shot 5-shot MANN, no conv <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Santoro et al., 2016)</ref> 82.8% 94.9% --MAML, no conv (ours)</p><p>89.7 ± 1.1% 97.5 ± 0.6% --Siamese nets <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Koch, 2015)</ref> 97.3% 98.4% 88.2% 97.0% matching nets <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Vinyals et al., 2016)</ref> 98.1% 98.9% 93.8% 98.5% neural statistician <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Edwards &amp; Storkey, 2017)</ref> 98.1% 99.5% 93.2% 98.1% memory mod. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Kaiser et al., 2017)</ref> 98.4% 99.6% 95.0% 98.6% MAML (ours)</p><p>98.7 ± 0.4% 99.9 ± 0.1% 95.8 ± 0.3% 98.9 ± 0.2%</p><p>5-way Accuracy MiniImagenet <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ravi &amp; Larochelle, 2017)</ref> 1-shot 5-shot fine-tuning baseline 28.86 ± 0.54% 49.79 ± 0.79% nearest neighbor baseline 41.08 ± 0.70% 51.04 ± 0.65% matching nets <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Vinyals et al., 2016)</ref> 43.56 ± 0.84% 55.31 ± 0.73% meta-learner LSTM <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Ravi &amp; Larochelle, 2017)</ref> 43.44 ± 0.77% 60.60 ± 0.71% MAML, first order approx. <ref type="formula">(ours)</ref> 48.07 ± 1.75% 63.15 ± 0.91% MAML (ours)</p><p>48.70 ± 1.84% 63.11 ± 0.92%</p><p>fewer overall parameters compared to matching networks and the meta-learner LSTM, since the algorithm does not introduce any additional parameters beyond the weights of the classifier itself. Compared to these prior methods, memory-augmented neural networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Santoro et al., 2016)</ref> specifically, and recurrent meta-learning models in general, represent a more broadly applicable class of methods that, like MAML, can be used for other tasks such as reinforcement learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Duan et al., 2016b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Wang et al., 2016)</ref>. However, as shown in the comparison, MAML significantly outperforms memory-augmented networks and the meta-learner LSTM on 5-way Omniglot and MiniImagenet classification, both in the 1-shot and 5-shot case.</p><p>A significant computational expense in MAML comes from the use of second derivatives when backpropagating the meta-gradient through the gradient operator in the meta-objective (see Equation <ref type="formula">(1)</ref>). On MiniImagenet, we show a comparison to a first-order approximation of MAML, where these second derivatives are omitted. Note that the resulting method still computes the meta-gradient at the post-update parameter values θ i , which provides for effective meta-learning. Surprisingly however, the performance of this method is nearly the same as that obtained with full second derivatives, suggesting that most of the improvement in MAML comes from the gradients of the objective at the post-update parameter values, rather than the second order updates from differentiating through the gradient update. Past work has observed that ReLU neural networks are locally almost linear <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Goodfellow et al., 2015)</ref>, which suggests that second derivatives may be close to zero in most cases, partially explaining the good perfor- mance of the first-order approximation. This approximation removes the need for computing Hessian-vector products in an additional backward pass, which we found led to roughly 33% speed-up in network computation.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.3.">Reinforcement Learning</head><p>To evaluate MAML on reinforcement learning problems, we constructed several sets of tasks based off of the simulated continuous control environments in the rllab benchmark suite <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Duan et al., 2016a)</ref>. We discuss the individual domains below. In all of the domains, the model trained by MAML is a neural network policy with two hidden layers of size 100, with ReLU nonlinearities. The gradient updates are computed using vanilla policy gradient (RE-INFORCE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Williams, 1992)</ref>, and we use trust-region policy optimization (TRPO) as the meta-optimizer <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(Schulman et al., 2015)</ref>. In order to avoid computing third derivatives, <ref type="figure">Figure 5</ref>. Reinforcement learning results for the half-cheetah and ant locomotion tasks, with the tasks shown on the far right. Each gradient step requires additional samples from the environment, unlike the supervised learning tasks. The results show that MAML can adapt to new goal velocities and directions substantially faster than conventional pretraining or random initialization, achieving good performs in just two or three gradient steps. We exclude the goal velocity, random baseline curves, since the returns are much worse (&lt; −200 for cheetah and &lt; −25 for ant).</p><p>we use finite differences to compute the Hessian-vector products for TRPO. For both learning and meta-learning updates, we use the standard linear feature baseline proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Duan et al. (2016a)</ref>, which is fitted separately at each iteration for each sampled task in the batch. We compare to three baseline models: (a) pretraining one policy on all of the tasks and then fine-tuning, (b) training a policy from randomly initialized weights, and (c) an oracle policy which receives the parameters of the task as input, which for the tasks below corresponds to a goal position, goal direction, or goal velocity for the agent. The baseline models of (a) and (b) are fine-tuned with gradient descent with a manually tuned step size. Videos of the learned policies can be viewed at sites.google.com/view/maml 2D Navigation. In our first meta-RL experiment, we study a set of tasks where a point agent must move to different goal positions in 2D, randomly chosen for each task within a unit square. The observation is the current 2D position, and actions correspond to velocity commands clipped to be in the range [−0.1, 0.1]. The reward is the negative squared distance to the goal, and episodes terminate when the agent is within 0.01 of the goal or at the horizon of H = 100. The policy was trained with MAML to maximize performance after 1 policy gradient update using 20 trajectories. Additional hyperparameter settings for this problem and the following RL problems are in Appendix A.2. In our evaluation, we compare adaptation to a new task with up to 4 gradient updates, each with 40 samples. The results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 4</ref> show the adaptation performance of models that are initialized with MAML, conventional pretraining on the same set of tasks, random initialization, and an oracle policy that receives the goal position as input. The results show that MAML can learn a model that adapts much more quickly in a single gradient update, and furthermore continues to improve with additional updates. Locomotion. To study how well MAML can scale to more complex deep RL problems, we also study adaptation on high-dimensional locomotion tasks with the MuJoCo simulator <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Todorov et al., 2012)</ref>. The tasks require two simulated robots -a planar cheetah and a 3D quadruped (the "ant") -to run in a particular direction or at a particular velocity. In the goal velocity experiments, the reward is the negative absolute value between the current velocity of the agent and a goal, which is chosen uniformly at random between 0.0 and 2.0 for the cheetah and between 0.0 and 3.0 for the ant. In the goal direction experiments, the reward is the magnitude of the velocity in either the forward or backward direction, chosen at random for each task in p(T ). The horizon is H = 200, with 20 rollouts per gradient step for all problems except the ant forward/backward task, which used 40 rollouts per step. The results in <ref type="bibr">Figure 5</ref> show that MAML learns a model that can quickly adapt its velocity and direction with even just a single gradient update, and continues to improve with more gradient steps. The results also show that, on these challenging tasks, the MAML initialization substantially outperforms random initialization and pretraining. In fact, pretraining is in some cases worse than random initialization, a fact observed in prior RL work <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Parisotto et al., 2016)</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6.">Discussion and Future Work</head><p>We introduced a meta-learning method based on learning easily adaptable model parameters through gradient descent. Our approach has a number of benefits. It is simple and does not introduce any learned parameters for metalearning. It can be combined with any model representation that is amenable to gradient-based training, and any differentiable objective, including classification, regression, and reinforcement learning. Lastly, since our method merely produces a weight initialization, adaptation can be performed with any amount of data and any number of gradient steps, though we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on classification with only one or five examples per class. We also show that our method can adapt an RL agent using policy gradients and a very modest amount of experience.</p><p>Reusing knowledge from past tasks may be a crucial ingredient in making high-capacity scalable models, such as deep neural networks, amenable to fast training with small datasets. We believe that this work is one step toward a simple and general-purpose meta-learning technique that can be applied to any problem and any model. Further research in this area can make multitask initialization a standard ingredient in deep learning and reinforcement learning.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head></head><label></label><figDesc>Each task involves regress- ing from the input to the output of a sine wave, where the amplitude and phase of the sinusoid are varied between tasks.

During training and testing, datapoints x are sampled uni- formly from [−5.0, 5.0]. The loss is the mean-squared error between the prediction f (x) and true value. The regres- sor is a neural network model with 2 hidden layers of size 40 with ReLU nonlinearities.
