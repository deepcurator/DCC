<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><p>Abstract. Efficient CNN designs like ResNets and DenseNet were proposed to improve accuracy vs efficiency trade-offs. They essentially increased the connectivity, allowing efficient information flow across layers. Inspired by these techniques, we propose to model connections between filters of a CNN using graphs which are simultaneously sparse and well connected. Sparsity results in efficiency while well connectedness can preserve the expressive power of the CNNs. We use a well-studied class of graphs from theoretical computer science that satisfies these properties known as Expander graphs. Expander graphs are used to model connections between filters in CNNs to design networks called X-Nets. We present two guarantees on the connectivity of X-Nets: Each node influences every node in a layer in logarithmic steps, and the number of paths between two sets of nodes is proportional to the product of their sizes. We also propose efficient training and inference algorithms, making it possible to train deeper and wider X-Nets effectively.</p><p>Expander based models give a 4% improvement in accuracy on MobileNet over grouped convolutions, a popular technique, which has the same sparsity but worse connectivity. X-Nets give better performance trade-offs than the original ResNet and DenseNet-BC architectures. We achieve model sizes comparable to state-of-the-art pruning techniques using our simple architecture design, without any pruning. We hope that this work motivates other approaches to utilize results from graph theory to develop efficient network architectures.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1">Introduction</head><p>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) achieve state-of-the-art results in a variety of machine learning applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>. However, they are also computationally intensive and consume a large amount of computing power and runtime memory. After the success of VGG Networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, there has been significant interest in designing compact neural network architectures due to the wide range of applications valuing mobile and embedded devices based use cases. ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and DenseNet-BC <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> directed the focus of efficient designs of convolutional layers on increasing connectivity. Additional connectivity with residual connections to previous layers provided efficient information flow through the network, enabling them to achieve an order of magnitude reduction in storage and computational requirements. We take inspiration from these approaches, to focus on designing highly connected networks. We explore making networks efficient by designing sparse networks that preserve connectivity properties. Recent architectures like MobileNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> improves the efficiency by an order of magnitude over a ResNet. However, in order to achieve this, they sparsify a network by removing several connections from a trained network, reducing their accuracies in the process. We ask a basic question: If we try to maximize the connectivity properties and information flow, can we achieve the same efficiency gains with minimal loss in accuracy? It is essential that the connections allow information to flow through the network easily. That is, each output node must at least have the capacity to be sensitive to features of previous layers. As we can see from <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">Fig.1</ref>, traditional model compression techniques such as pruning can aggravate the problem, since they can prune the neuron connections of a layer, while being agnostic of global connectivity of the network. A necessary condition for having good representational power is efficient information flow through the network, which is particularly suited to be modeled by graphs. We propose to make the connections between neurons (filters in the case of CNNs) according to specific graph constructions known as expander graphs. They have been widely studied in spectral graph theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and pseudorandomness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and are known to be sparse but highly connected graphs. Expander graphs have a long history in theoretical computer science, also being used in practice in computer networks, constructing error correcting codes, and in cryptography (for a survey, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>).</p><p>Main Contributions: i.) We propose to represent neuronal connections in deep networks using expander graphs (see Section 3). We further prove that X-Nets have strong connectivity properties (see <ref type="bibr">Theorem 1)</ref>. ii.) We provide memory-efficient implementations of Convolutional (X-Conv) layers using sparse matrices and propose a fast expander-specific algorithm (see Section 4). iii.) We empirically compare X-Conv layers with grouped convolutions that have the same level of sparsity but worse connectivity. X-Conv layers obtain a 4% improvement in accuracy when both the techniques are applied to the MobileNet architecture trained on Imagenet (see Section 5.1). iv.) We also demonstrate the robustness of our approach by applying the technique to some of the state of the art models like DenseNet-BC and ResNet, obtaining better performance tradeoffs (see Section 5.2). v.) Additionally, our simple design achieves comparable compression rates to even the state-of-the-art trained pruning techniques. (see Section 5.3). vi.) Since we enforce the sparsity before the training phase itself, our models are inherently compact and faster to train compared to pruning techniques. We leverage this and showcase the performance of wider and deeper X-Nets (see Section 5.5).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2">Related Work</head><p>Our approach lies at the intersection of trained pruning techniques and efficient layer design techniques. We present a literature survey regarding both the directions in detail.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.1">Efficient Layer Designs</head><p>Currently there is extensive interest in developing novel convolutional layers/blocks and effectively leveraging them to improve architectures like <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>. Such micro-architecture design is in a similar direction as our work. In contrast, approaches like <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> try to design the macro-architectures by connecting pre-existing blocks. Recent concurrent work has been on performing architecture searches effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>. Our work is complementary to architecture search techniques as we can leverage their optimized macro-architectures.</p><p>Another line of efficient architecture design is Grouped Convolutions: which was first proposed in AlexNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, recently popularized by MobileNets <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and XCeption <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> architectures . This is currently a very active area of current research, with a lot of new concurrent work being proposed <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</p><p>It is interesting to note that recent breakthroughs in designing accurate deep networks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> were mainly by introducing additional connectivity to enable the efficient flow of information through deep networks. This enables the training of compact, accurate deep networks. These approaches, along with Grouped Convolutions are closely related to our approach.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2">Network Compression</head><p>Several methods have been introduced to compress pre-trained networks as well as train-time compression. Models typically range from low-rank decomposition <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> to network pruning <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</p><p>There is also a major body of work that quantizes the networks at traintime to achieve efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>. The problem of pruning weights in train-time have been extensively explored <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref> primarily from weight-level <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref> to channel-level pruning <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>. Weight-level pruning has the highest compression rate while channel-level pruning is easier to practically exploit and has compression rates almost on par with the former. Hence, channellevel pruning is currently considered superior <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>. Channel-level pruning approaches started out with no guidance for sparsity <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> and eventually added constraints <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, tending towards more structured pruning.</p><p>However, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at constraining neural network connections by graph-theoretic approaches to improve deep network architecture designs. Note that we do not prune weights during training.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3">Approach</head><p>Recent breakthroughs in CNN architectures like ResNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> and DenseNet-BC <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> are ideas based on increasing connectivity, which resulted in better performance trade-offs. These works suggest that connectivity is an important property for improving the performance of deep CNNs. In that vein, we investigate ways of preserving connectivity between neurons while significantly sparsifying the connections between them. Such networks are expected to preserve accuracy (due to connectivity) while being runtime efficient (due to the sparsity). We empirically demonstrate this in the later sections.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.1">Graphs and Deep CNNs</head><p>We model the connections between neurons as graphs. This enables us to leverage well-studied concepts from Graph Theory like Expander Graphs. Now, we proceed to formally describe the connection between graphs and Deep CNNs.</p><p>Linear Layer defined by a Graph: Given a bipartite graph G with vertices U, V , the Linear layer defined by G, is a layer with |U | input neurons, |V | output neurons and each output neuron v ∈ V is only connected to the neighbors given by G. Let the graph G be sparse, having only M edges. Then this layer has only M parameters as compared to |V | × |U |, which is the size of typical linear layers.</p><p>Convolutional Layer defined by a Graph: Let a Convolutional layer be defined as a bipartite graph G with vertices U, V and a window size of c × c.</p><p>This layer takes a 3D input with |U | channels and produces a 3D output with |V | channels. The output channel corresponding to a vertex v ∈ V is computed only using the input channels corresponding the the neighbors of v. Let G be sparse, having only M edges. Hence the kernel of this convolutional layer has M × c × c parameters as compared to |V | × |U | × c × c, which is the number of parameters in a vanilla CNN layer.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.2">Sparse Random Graphs</head><p>We want to constrain our convolutional layers to form a sparse graph G. Without any prior knowledge of the data distribution, we take inspiration from randomized algorithms and propose choosing the neighbours of every output neuron/channel uniformly and independently at random from the set of all its input channels. It is known that a graph G obtained in this way belongs to a wellstudied category of graphs called Expander Graphs, known to be sparse but well connected.</p><p>Expander Graph: A bipartite expander with degree D and spectral gap γ, is a bipartite graph G = (U, V, E) (E is the set of edges, E ⊆ U × V ) in which:</p><p>1.) Sparsity: Every vertex in V has only D neighbors in U . We will be using constructions with D &lt;&lt; |U |. Hence the number of edges is only D × |V | as compared to |U | × |V | in a dense graph.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2.) Spectral Gap:</head><p>The eigenvalue with the second largest absolute value λ of the adjacency matrix is bounded away from D (the largest eigenvalue).</p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Formally 1 − λ/D ≥ γ.</formula><p>Random expanders: A random bipartite expander of degree D on the two vertex sets U, V , is a graph in which for every vertex v ∈ V , the D neighbors are chosen independently and uniformly from U . It is a well-known result in graph theory that such graphs have a large spectral gap ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>). Similar to random expanders, there exist several explicit expander constructions. More details about explicit expanders can be found in the supplementary section. We now proceed to give constructions of deep networks that have connections defined by an expander graph.</p><p>Expander Linear Layer (X-Linear): The Expander Linear (X-Linear) layer is a layer defined by a random bipartite expander G with degree D. The expander graphs that we use have values of D &lt;&lt; |U |, while having an expansion factor of K ≈ D, which ensures that the layer still has good expressive power.</p><p>Expander Convolutional Layer (X-Conv): The Expander Convolutional (X-Conv) layer is a convolutional layer defined by a random bipartite expander graph G with degree D, where D &lt;&lt; |U |.</p><p>Deep Expander Networks (X-Nets): Given expander graphs</p><formula xml:id="formula_1">G 1 = (V 0 , V 1 , E 1 ), G 2 = (V 1 , V 2 , E 2 ), · · · , G t = (V t−1 , V t , E t )</formula><p>, we define the Deep Expander Convolutional Network (Convolutional X-Net or simply X-Net) as a t layer deep network in which the convolutional layers are replaced by X-Conv layers and linear layers are replaced by X-Linear layers defined by the corresponding graphs. We represent all the non-zero filters in the weight matrix of the X-Conv layer as a compressed dense matrix of D channels. The algorithm starts by selecting D channels from input (with replacement) using a mask created while initializing the model. The output is computed by convolving these selected channels with the compressed weight matrices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.3">Measures of Connectivity</head><p>In this subsection, we describe some connectivity properties of Expander graphs (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, for the proofs). These will be used to prove the properties of sensitivity and mixing of random walks in X-Nets . Expansion: For every subset S ⊆ V of size ≤ α|V | (α ∈ (0, 1) depends on the construction), let N (S) be the set of neighbors. Then |N (S)| ≥ K|S| for K ≈ D. That is, the neighbors of the vertices in S are almost distinct. It is known that random expanders have expansion factor K ≈ D (see Theorem 4.4 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>).</p><p>Small Diameter: The diameter of a graph is the length of the longest path among all shortest paths. If G(U, V, E) is a D-regular expander with expansion factor K &gt; 1 and diameter d, then d ≤ O(log n). This bound on the diameter implies that for any pair of vertices, there is a path of length O(log n) in the graph.</p><p>Mixing of Random Walks: Random walks in the graph quickly converge to the uniform distribution over nodes of the graph. If we start from any vertex and keep moving to a random neighbor, in O(log n) steps the distribution will be close to uniform over the set of vertices.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3.4">Sensitivity of X-Nets</head><p>X-Nets have multiple layers, each of which have connections derived from an expander graph. We can guarantee that the output nodes in such a network are sensitive to all the input nodes.</p><p>Theorem 1 (Sensitivity of X-Nets). Let n be the number of input as well as output nodes in the network and G 1 , G 2 , · · · , G t be D regular bipartite expander graphs with n nodes on both sides. Then every output neuron is sensitive to every input in a Deep X-Net defined by G i 's with depth t = O(log n).</p><p>Proof. For every pair of input and output (u, v), we show that there is a path in the X-Net. The proof is essentially related to the the fact that expander graphs have diameter O(log n). A detailed proof can be found in the supplementary material.</p><p>Next, we show a much stronger connectivity property known as mixing for the X-Nets. The theorem essentially says that the number of edges between subsets of input and output nodes is proportional to the product of their sizes. This result implies that the connectivity properties are uniform and rich across all nodes as well as subsets of nodes of the same size. Simply put, all nodes tend to have equally rich representational power.</p><p>Theorem 2 (Mixing in X-Nets). Let n be the number of input as well as output nodes in the network and G be D regular bipartite expander graph with n nodes on both sides. Let S, T be subsets of input and output nodes in the X-Net layer defined by G. The number of edges between S and T is ≈ D|S||T |/n Proof. A detailed proof is provided in the supplementary material.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4">Efficient Algorithms</head><p>In this section, we present efficient algorithms of X-Conv layers. Our algorithms achieve speedups and save memory in the training as well as the inference phase. This enables one to experiment with significantly wider and deeper networks given memory and runtime constraints. We exploit the structured sparsity of expander graphs to design fast algorithms. We propose two methods of training X-Nets, both requiring substantially less memory and computational cost than their vanilla counterparts: 1) Using Sparse Representations 2) Expander-Specific Fast Algorithms.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.1">Using Sparse Representation</head><p>The adjacency matrices of expander graphs are highly sparse for D &lt;&lt; n. Hence, we can initialize a sparse matrix with non-zero entries corresponding to the edges of the expander graphs. Unlike most pruning techniques, the sparse connections are determined before training phase, and stay fixed. Dense-Sparse convolutions are easy to implement, and are supported by most deep learning libraries. CNN libraries like Cuda-convnet <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> support such random sparse convolution algorithms. </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4.2">X-Net based Fast Dense Convolution</head><p>Next, we present fast algorithms that exploit the sparsity of expander graphs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>X-Conv:</head><p>In an X-Conv layer, every output channel is only sensitive to out rom input channels. We propose to use a mask to select D channels of the input, and then convolve with a c × c × D × 1 kernel, obtaining a single channel per filter in the output. The mask is obtained by choosing D samples uniformly (without replacement) from the set {1, · · · N }, where N is the number of input channels. The mask value is 1 for each of the selected D channels and 0 for others (see Algorithm 4.1). This is illustrated in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref>. There has been recent work about fast CUDA implementations called Block-Sparse GPU Kernels <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, which can implement this algorithm efficiently.  . We show the error as a function of #FLOPs during test-time (below) for DenseNet-BC with X-DenseNet-BCs on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. We observe X-DenseNet-BCs achieve better performance tradeoffs over DenseNet-BC models. For each datapoint, we mention the X-C-D-G notation (see Section 5.2) along with the accuracy.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5">Experiments and Results</head><p>In this section, we benchmark and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of X-Nets on a variety of CNN architectures. Our code is available at: https: //github.com/DrImpossible/Deep-Expander-Networks.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.1">Comparison with Grouped Convolution</head><p>First, we compare our Expander Convolutions (X-Conv) against Grouped Convolutions (G-Conv). We choose G-Conv as it is a popular approach, on which a lot of concurrent works <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> have developed their ideas. G-Conv networks have the same sparsity as X-Conv networks but lack only the connectivity property. This will test whether increasing connectivity increases accuracy, i.e does a graph without good connectivity properties provides worse accuracy? We choose MobileNet as the base model for this experiment, since it is the state-of-the-art in efficient CNN architectures. We compare X-Conv against grouped convolutions using MobileNet-0.5 on the ImageNet classification task. We replace the 1 × 1 convolutional layers in MobileNet-0.5 with X-Conv layers forming X-MobileNet-0.5. Similarly, we replace them with G-Conv layers to form Group-MobileNet-0.5. Note that we perform this only in layers with most number of parameters (after the 8th layer as given in <ref type="table">Table 1</ref> of <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>). We present our results in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">Figure 3</ref>. The reference original MobileNet-0.5 has an error of 36.6% with a cost of 150M FLOPs. Additional implementation details are given in the supplementary material.</p><p>We can observe that X-MobileNets beat Group-MobileNets by over 4% in terms of accuracy when we increase sparsity. This also demonstrates that X-Conv can be used to further improve the efficiency of even the most efficient architectures like MobileNet.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.2">Comparison with Efficient CNN Architectures</head><p>In this section, we test whether Expander Graphs can improve the performance trade-offs even in state-of-the-art architectures such as DenseNet-BCs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and ResNets <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> on the ImageNet <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref> dataset.

We compare across various models like ResNets-34,50,101. Similarly, our X-DenseNet-BC-C-D-G architecture has depth D, and growth rate G. We use DenseNet-BC-121-32,169-32,161-48,201-32 as base models. These networks have every layer except the first and last replaced by an X-Conv layer that compresses connections between it and the previous layer by a factor of C.

We observe that we can achieve upto 33% compression keeping accuracy constant on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.</p><p>We compare our approach with methods which prune the weights during or after training. Our method can be thought of as constraining the weight matrices with a well studied sparse connectivity pattern even before the training starts. This results in fast training for the compact X-Conv models, while the trained pruning techniques face the following challenges: 1) Slow initial training due to full dense model. 2) Several additional phases of pruning and retraining.</p><p>Hence they achieve the compactness and runtime efficiency only in test time. Nevertheless we show similar sparsity can be achieved by our approach without explicitly pruning. We benchmark on VGG16 and AlexNet architectures since most previous results in the pruning literature have been reported on these architectures. In <ref type="table">Table 2</ref>, we compare two X-VGG-16 models against existing pruning techniques. We achieve comparable accuracies to the previous state-ofthe-art model with 50% fewer parameters and #FLOPs. Similarly, in <ref type="table">Table 3</ref> we compare X-AlexNet with trained pruning techniques on the Imagenet dataset. Despite having poor connectivity due to parameters being concentrated only in the last three fully connected layers, we achieve similar accuracy to AlexNet model using only 7.6M-9.7M parameters out of 61M, comparable to the state-ofthe-art pruning techniques which have upto 3.4M-5.9M parameters. Additionally, it is possible to improve compression by applying pruning methods on our compact architectures, but pruning X-Nets is out of the scope of our current work.</p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.4">Stability of Models</head><p>We give empirical evidence as well as a theoretical argument regarding the stability of our method. For the vanilla DNN training, the weights are randomly initialized, and randomized techniques like dropouts, augmentation are used. Hence there is some randomness present and is well accepted in DNN literature prior to our method. We repeat experiments on different datasets (Imagenet and CIFAR10) and architectures (VGG, DenseNet and MobileNet0.5) to empirically show that the accuracy of expander based models has variance similar to vanilla DNN training over multiple runs.</p><p>We repeated the experiments with independent sampling of random expanders on the VGG and DenseNet baselines on the CIFAR10 dataset. The results can be seen in <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table 4</ref>. It is noted that the accuracy values changes only by less than 0.3% across runs and the standard deviation of expander method is also comparable to the vanilla DNN training.</p><p>We also repeated experiments of our main result, which is the comparison with grouped convolutions on ImageNet dataset. We rerun the experiment with MobileNet0.5 feature extractor twice with Groups and the expander method. As can be seen from <ref type="table" target="#tab_2">Table 5</ref>, the accuracy variations are comparable between the two models, and it is less than 1%.</p><p>A theoretical argument also concludes that choosing random graphs doesn't degrade stability. It is a well known result (See Theorem 4.4 in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>) in random graph theory, that graphs chosen randomly are well connected with overwhelmingly high probability (with only inverse exponentially small error, due to the Chernoff's Tail bounds) and satisfies the Expander properties. Hence the chance that for a specific run, the accuracy gets affected due to the selection of a particularly badly connected graph is insignificant.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="5.5">Training Wider and Deeper networks</head><p>Since X-Nets involve constraining the weight matrices to sparse connectivity patterns before training, the fast algorithms can make it possible to utilize memory and runtime efficiently in training phase. This makes it possible to train significantly deeper and wider networks. Note the contrast with pruning techniques, where it is necessary to train the full, bulky model, inherently limiting the range of models that can be compressed. Wide-DenseNets 1 offered a better accuracy-memory-time trade-off. We increase the width and depth of these networks to train significantly wider and deeper networks. The aim is to study whether leveraging the effectiveness of X-Nets in this fashion can lead to better accuracies. We widen and deepen the DenseNet-BC-40-60 architecture, increasing the growth rate from 60 to 100 and 200 respectively and compare the effect of increasing width on these new models. Similarly, we increase the depth from 40 to 58 and 70 to obtain deeper networks. We benchmark these approaches using CIFAR-100 dataset and present the results in <ref type="figure">Figure 6</ref>.</p><p>We have two interesting observations. First, the deeper X-DenseNet-BC-70-60 significantly outperforms X-DenseNet-BC-58-60 and wider X-DenseNet-40-200 outperforms X-DenseNet-BC-40-100 with fewer parameters for a wide range of C values (Expander degree).</p><p>The second interesting observation is the decreasing slope of the curves. This indicates that expander graph modeling seems to be effective on wider and deeper X-Nets i.e X-DenseNet-BC models suffer lesser penalty with increasing depth and width compression. This enables X-Nets to work at high compression rates of 30x, compressing DenseNet-BC-40-200 model from 19.9B FLOPs to 0.6B FLOPs with only 4.3% drop in accuracy. We hope this preliminary investigation holds significant value in alleviating the constraint of GPU memory and resources.  <ref type="figure">6</ref>. We show the performance tradeoff obtained on training significantly wider and deeper networks on CIFAR-100 dataset. Every datapoint is X-C specified along with the number of parameters, C being the compression factor. We show that training wider or deeper networks along with more compression using X-Nets achieve better accuracies with upto two-thirds of the total parameter and FLOPs on CIFAR-100 dataset.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="6">Conclusion</head><p>We proposed a new network layer architecture for deep networks using expander graphs that give strong theoretical guarantees on connectivity. The resulting architecture (X-Net) is shown to be highly efficient in terms of both computational requirements and model size. In addition to being compact and computationally efficient, the connectivity properties of the network allow us to achieve significant improvements over the state-of-the-art architectures in performance on a parameter or run-time budget. In short, we show that the use of principled approaches that sparsify a model while maintaining global information flows can help in developing efficient deep networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at using theoretical results from graph theory in modeling connectivity to improve deep network architectures. We believe that the field of deep networks can gain significantly from other similar explorations.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
