We propose MoNoise: a normalization model focused on generalizability and
efficiency, it aims at being easily reusable and adaptable. Normalization is
the task of translating texts from a non- canonical domain to a more canonical
domain, in our case: from social media data to standard language. Our proposed
model is based on a modular candidate generation in which each module is
responsible for a different type of normalization action. The most important
generation modules are a spelling correction system and a word embeddings
module. Depending on the definition of the normalization task, a static lookup
list can be crucial for performance. We train a random forest classifier to
rank the candidates, which generalizes well to all different types of
normaliza- tion actions. Most features for the ranking originate from the
generation modules; besides these features, N-gram features prove to be an
important source of information. We show that MoNoise beats the
state-of-the-art on different normalization benchmarks for English and Dutch,
which all define the task of normalization slightly different.
