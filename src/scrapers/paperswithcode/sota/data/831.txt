We describe Microsoft's conversational speech recognition system, in which we
combine recent developments in neural-network-based acoustic and language
modeling to advance the state of the art on the Switchboard recognition task.
Inspired by machine learning ensemble techniques, the system uses a range of
convolutional and recurrent neural networks. I-vector modeling and lattice-free
MMI training provide significant gains for all acoustic model architectures.
Language model rescoring with multiple forward and backward running RNNLMs, and
word posterior-based system combination provide a 20% boost. The best single
system uses a ResNet architecture acoustic model with RNNLM rescoring, and
achieves a word error rate of 6.9% on the NIST 2000 Switchboard task. The
combined system has an error rate of 6.2%, representing an improvement over
previously reported results on this benchmark task.
