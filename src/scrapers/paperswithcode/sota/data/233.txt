We present a novel architecture, the "stacked what-where auto-encoders"
(SWWAE), which integrates discriminative and generative pathways and provides a
unified approach to supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning
without relying on sampling during training. An instantiation of SWWAE uses a
convolutional net (Convnet) (LeCun et al. (1998)) to encode the input, and
employs a deconvolutional net (Deconvnet) (Zeiler et al. (2010)) to produce the
reconstruction. The objective function includes reconstruction terms that
induce the hidden states in the Deconvnet to be similar to those of the
Convnet. Each pooling layer produces two sets of variables: the "what" which
are fed to the next layer, and its complementary variable "where" that are fed
to the corresponding layer in the generative decoder.
