This paper tackles the reduction of redundant repeating generation that is often observed in RNN-based encoder-decoder models. Our basic idea is to jointly estimate the upper-bound frequency of each target vocabulary in the encoder and control the output words based on the estimation in the decoder. Our method shows significant improvement over a strong RNN-based encoder-decoder baseline and achieved its best results on an abstractive summarization benchmark.
