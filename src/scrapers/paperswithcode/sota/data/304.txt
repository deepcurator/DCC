Faster RCNN has achieved great success for generic object detection including
PASCAL object detection and MS COCO object detection. In this report, we
propose a detailed designed Faster RCNN method named FDNet1.0 for face
detection. Several techniques were employed including multi-scale training,
multi-scale testing, light-designed RCNN, some tricks for inference and a
vote-based ensemble method. Our method achieves two 1th places and one 2nd
place in three tasks over WIDER FACE validation dataset (easy set, medium set,
hard set).
