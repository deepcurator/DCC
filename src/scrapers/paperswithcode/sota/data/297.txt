Since convolutional neural network (CNN) lacks an inherent mechanism to
handle large scale variations, we always need to compute feature maps multiple
times for multi-scale object detection, which has the bottleneck of
computational cost in practice. To address this, we devise a recurrent scale
approximation (RSA) to compute feature map once only, and only through this map
can we approximate the rest maps on other levels. At the core of RSA is the
recursive rolling out mechanism: given an initial map at a particular scale, it
generates the prediction at a smaller scale that is half the size of input. To
further increase efficiency and accuracy, we (a): design a scale-forecast
network to globally predict potential scales in the image since there is no
need to compute maps on all levels of the pyramid. (b): propose a landmark
retracing network (LRN) to trace back locations of the regressed landmarks and
generate a confidence score for each landmark; LRN can effectively alleviate
false positives caused by the accumulated error in RSA. The whole system can be
trained end-to-end in a unified CNN framework. Experiments demonstrate that our
proposed algorithm is superior against state-of-the-art methods on face
detection benchmarks and achieves comparable results for generic proposal
generation. The source code of RSA is available at
