In this paper, we propose Emo2Vec which encodes emotional semantics into
vectors. We train Emo2Vec by multi-task learning six different emotion-related
tasks, including emotion/sentiment analysis, sarcasm classification, stress
detection, abusive language classification, insult detection, and personality
recognition. Our evaluation of Emo2Vec shows that it outperforms existing
affect-related representations, such as Sentiment-Specific Word Embedding and
DeepMoji embeddings with much smaller training corpora. When concatenated with
GloVe, Emo2Vec achieves competitive performances to state-of-the-art results on
several tasks using a simple logistic regression classifier.
