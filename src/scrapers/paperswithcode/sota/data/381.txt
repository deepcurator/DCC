Molecular "fingerprints" encoding structural information are the workhorse of
cheminformatics and machine learning in drug discovery applications. However,
fingerprint representations necessarily emphasize particular aspects of the
molecular structure while ignoring others, rather than allowing the model to
make data-driven decisions. We describe molecular "graph convolutions", a
machine learning architecture for learning from undirected graphs, specifically
small molecules. Graph convolutions use a simple encoding of the molecular
graph---atoms, bonds, distances, etc.---which allows the model to take greater
advantage of information in the graph structure. Although graph convolutions do
not outperform all fingerprint-based methods, they (along with other
graph-based methods) represent a new paradigm in ligand-based virtual screening
with exciting opportunities for future improvement.
