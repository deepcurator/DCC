We learn to compute optical flow by combining a classical spatial-pyramid
formulation with deep learning. This estimates large motions in a
coarse-to-fine approach by warping one image of a pair at each pyramid level by
the current flow estimate and computing an update to the flow. Instead of the
standard minimization of an objective function at each pyramid level, we train
one deep network per level to compute the flow update. Unlike the recent
FlowNet approach, the networks do not need to deal with large motions; these
are dealt with by the pyramid. This has several advantages. First, our Spatial
Pyramid Network (SPyNet) is much simpler and 96% smaller than FlowNet in terms
of model parameters. This makes it more efficient and appropriate for embedded
applications. Second, since the flow at each pyramid level is small (< 1
pixel), a convolutional approach applied to pairs of warped images is
appropriate. Third, unlike FlowNet, the learned convolution filters appear
similar to classical spatio-temporal filters, giving insight into the method
and how to improve it. Our results are more accurate than FlowNet on most
standard benchmarks, suggesting a new direction of combining classical flow
methods with deep learning.
