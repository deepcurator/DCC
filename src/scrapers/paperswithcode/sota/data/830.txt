Conversational speech recognition has served as a flagship speech recognition
task since the release of the Switchboard corpus in the 1990s. In this paper,
we measure the human error rate on the widely used NIST 2000 test set, and find
that our latest automated system has reached human parity. The error rate of
professional transcribers is 5.9% for the Switchboard portion of the data, in
which newly acquainted pairs of people discuss an assigned topic, and 11.3% for
the CallHome portion where friends and family members have open-ended
conversations. In both cases, our automated system establishes a new state of
the art, and edges past the human benchmark, achieving error rates of 5.8% and
11.0%, respectively. The key to our system's performance is the use of various
convolutional and LSTM acoustic model architectures, combined with a novel
spatial smoothing method and lattice-free MMI acoustic training, multiple
recurrent neural network language modeling approaches, and a systematic use of
system combination.
