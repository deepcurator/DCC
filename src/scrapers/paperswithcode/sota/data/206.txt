Hand pose estimation from a single depth image is an essential topic in
computer vision and human computer interaction. Despite recent advancements in
this area promoted by convolutional neural network, accurate hand pose
estimation is still a challenging problem. In this paper we propose a Pose
guided structured Region Ensemble Network (Pose-REN) to boost the performance
of hand pose estimation. The proposed method extracts regions from the feature
maps of convolutional neural network under the guide of an initially estimated
pose, generating more optimal and representative features for hand pose
estimation. The extracted feature regions are then integrated hierarchically
according to the topology of hand joints by employing tree-structured fully
connections. A refined estimation of hand pose is directly regressed by the
proposed network and the final hand pose is obtained by utilizing an iterative
cascaded method. Comprehensive experiments on public hand pose datasets
demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms.
