The task of labeling data for training deep neural networks is daunting and
tedious, requiring millions of labels to achieve the current state-of-the-art
results. Such reliance on large amounts of labeled data can be relaxed by
exploiting hierarchical features via unsupervised learning techniques. In this
work, we propose to train a deep convolutional network based on an enhanced
version of the k-means clustering algorithm, which reduces the number of
correlated parameters in the form of similar filters, and thus increases test
categorization accuracy. We call our algorithm convolutional k-means
clustering. We further show that learning the connection between the layers of
a deep convolutional neural network improves its ability to be trained on a
smaller amount of labeled data. Our experiments show that the proposed
algorithm outperforms other techniques that learn filters unsupervised.
Specifically, we obtained a test accuracy of 74.1% on STL-10 and a test error
of 0.5% on MNIST.
