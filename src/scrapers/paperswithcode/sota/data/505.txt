This paper proposes dynamic chunk reader (DCR), an end-to-end neural reading
comprehension (RC) model that is able to extract and rank a set of answer
candidates from a given document to answer questions. DCR is able to predict
answers of variable lengths, whereas previous neural RC models primarily
focused on predicting single tokens or entities. DCR encodes a document and an
input question with recurrent neural networks, and then applies a word-by-word
attention mechanism to acquire question-aware representations for the document,
followed by the generation of chunk representations and a ranking module to
propose the top-ranked chunk as the answer. Experimental results show that DCR
achieves state-of-the-art exact match and F1 scores on the SQuAD dataset.
