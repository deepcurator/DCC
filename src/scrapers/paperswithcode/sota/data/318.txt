We present a multi-purpose algorithm for simultaneous face detection, face
alignment, pose estimation, gender recognition, smile detection, age estimation
and face recognition using a single deep convolutional neural network (CNN).
The proposed method employs a multi-task learning framework that regularizes
the shared parameters of CNN and builds a synergy among different domains and
tasks. Extensive experiments show that the network has a better understanding
of face and achieves state-of-the-art result for most of these tasks.
