DeepPrior is a simple approach based on Deep Learning that predicts the joint
3D locations of a hand given a depth map. Since its publication early 2015, it
has been outperformed by several impressive works. Here we show that with
simple improvements: adding ResNet layers, data augmentation, and better
initial hand localization, we achieve better or similar performance than more
sophisticated recent methods on the three main benchmarks (NYU, ICVL, MSRA)
while keeping the simplicity of the original method. Our new implementation is
