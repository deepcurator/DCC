Problems at the intersection of vision and language are of significant
importance both as challenging research questions and for the rich set of
applications they enable. However, inherent structure in our world and bias in
our language tend to be a simpler signal for learning than visual modalities,
resulting in models that ignore visual information, leading to an inflated
sense of their capability.
We propose to counter these language priors for the task of Visual Question
Answering (VQA) and make vision (the V in VQA) matter! Specifically, we balance
the popular VQA dataset by collecting complementary images such that every
question in our balanced dataset is associated with not just a single image,
but rather a pair of similar images that result in two different answers to the
question. Our dataset is by construction more balanced than the original VQA
dataset and has approximately twice the number of image-question pairs. Our
complete balanced dataset is publicly available at www.visualqa.org as part of
the 2nd iteration of the Visual Question Answering Dataset and Challenge (VQA
v2.0).
We further benchmark a number of state-of-art VQA models on our balanced
dataset. All models perform significantly worse on our balanced dataset,
suggesting that these models have indeed learned to exploit language priors.
This finding provides the first concrete empirical evidence for what seems to
be a qualitative sense among practitioners.
Finally, our data collection protocol for identifying complementary images
enables us to develop a novel interpretable model, which in addition to
providing an answer to the given (image, question) pair, also provides a
counter-example based explanation. Specifically, it identifies an image that is
similar to the original image, but it believes has a different answer to the
same question. This can help in building trust for machines among their users.
