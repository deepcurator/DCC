In this work, a region-based Deep Convolutional Neural Network framework is
proposed for document structure learning. The contribution of this work
involves efficient training of region based classifiers and effective
ensembling for document image classification. A primary level of `inter-domain'
transfer learning is used by exporting weights from a pre-trained VGG16
architecture on the ImageNet dataset to train a document classifier on whole
document images. Exploiting the nature of region based influence modelling, a
secondary level of `intra-domain' transfer learning is used for rapid training
of deep learning models for image segments. Finally, stacked generalization
based ensembling is utilized for combining the predictions of the base deep
neural network models. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
of 92.2% on the popular RVL-CDIP document image dataset, exceeding benchmarks
set by existing algorithms.
