This paper presents the participation of Apollo’s team in the SemEval-2018 Task 9 “Hypernym Discovery”, Subtask 1: “General-Purpose Hypernym Discovery”, which tries to produce a ranked list of hypernyms for a specific term. We propose a novel approach for automatic extraction of hypernymy relations from a corpus by using dependency patterns. We estimated that the application of these patterns leads to a higher score than using the traditional lexical patterns.
