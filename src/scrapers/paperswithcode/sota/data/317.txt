Face recognition performance evaluation has traditionally focused on
one-to-one verification, popularized by the Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset
for imagery and the YouTubeFaces dataset for videos. In contrast, the newly
released IJB-A face recognition dataset unifies evaluation of one-to-many face
identification with one-to-one face verification over templates, or sets of
imagery and videos for a subject. In this paper, we study the problem of
template adaptation, a form of transfer learning to the set of media in a
template. Extensive performance evaluations on IJB-A show a surprising result,
that perhaps the simplest method of template adaptation, combining deep
convolutional network features with template specific linear SVMs, outperforms
the state-of-the-art by a wide margin. We study the effects of template size,
negative set construction and classifier fusion on performance, then compare
template adaptation to convolutional networks with metric learning, 2D and 3D
alignment. Our unexpected conclusion is that these other methods, when combined
with template adaptation, all achieve nearly the same top performance on IJB-A
for template-based face verification and identification.
