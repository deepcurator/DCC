Sequence-to-sequence attention-based models on subword units allow simple
open-vocabulary end-to-end speech recognition. In this work, we show that such
models can achieve competitive results on the Switchboard 300h and LibriSpeech
1000h tasks. In particular, we report the state-of-the-art word error rates
(WER) of 3.54% on the dev-clean and 3.82% on the test-clean evaluation subsets
of LibriSpeech. We introduce a new pretraining scheme by starting with a high
time reduction factor and lowering it during training, which is crucial both
for convergence and final performance. In some experiments, we also use an
auxiliary CTC loss function to help the convergence. In addition, we train long
short-term memory (LSTM) language models on subword units. By shallow fusion,
we report up to 27% relative improvements in WER over the attention baseline
without a language model.
