The huge variance of human pose and the misalignment of detected human images
significantly increase the difficulty of person Re-Identification (Re-ID).
Moreover, efficient Re-ID systems are required to cope with the massive visual
data being produced by video surveillance systems. Targeting to solve these
problems, this work proposes a Global-Local-Alignment Descriptor (GLAD) and an
efficient indexing and retrieval framework, respectively. GLAD explicitly
leverages the local and global cues in human body to generate a discriminative
and robust representation. It consists of part extraction and descriptor
learning modules, where several part regions are first detected and then deep
neural networks are designed for representation learning on both the local and
global regions. A hierarchical indexing and retrieval framework is designed to
eliminate the huge redundancy in the gallery set, and accelerate the online
Re-ID procedure. Extensive experimental results show GLAD achieves competitive
accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Our retrieval framework
significantly accelerates the online Re-ID procedure without loss of accuracy.
Therefore, this work has potential to work better on person Re-ID tasks in real
scenarios.
