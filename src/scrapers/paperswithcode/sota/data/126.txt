We focus on the challenging task of real-time semantic segmentation in this
paper. It finds many practical applications and yet is with fundamental
difficulty of reducing a large portion of computation for pixel-wise label
inference. We propose an image cascade network (ICNet) that incorporates
multi-resolution branches under proper label guidance to address this
challenge. We provide in-depth analysis of our framework and introduce the
cascade feature fusion unit to quickly achieve high-quality segmentation. Our
system yields real-time inference on a single GPU card with decent quality
results evaluated on challenging datasets like Cityscapes, CamVid and
COCO-Stuff.
