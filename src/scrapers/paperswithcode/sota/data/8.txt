Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently demonstrated to
successfully approximate complex data distributions. A relevant extension of
this model is conditional GANs (cGANs), where the introduction of external
information allows to determine specific representations of the generated
images. In this work, we evaluate encoders to inverse the mapping of a cGAN,
i.e., mapping a real image into a latent space and a conditional
representation. This allows, for example, to reconstruct and modify real images
of faces conditioning on arbitrary attributes. Additionally, we evaluate the
design of cGANs. The combination of an encoder with a cGAN, which we call
Invertible cGAN (IcGAN), enables to re-generate real images with deterministic
complex modifications.
