Facial expression recognition methods use a combination of geometric and
appearance-based features. Spatial features are derived from displacements of
facial landmarks, and carry geometric information. These features are either
selected based on prior knowledge, or dimension-reduced from a large pool. In
this study, we produce a large number of potential spatial features using two
combinations of facial landmarks. Among these, we search for a descriptive
subset of features using sequential forward selection. The chosen feature
subset is used to classify facial expressions in the extended Cohn-Kanade
dataset (CK+), and delivered 88.7% recognition accuracy without using any
appearance-based features.
