We propose a novel neural attention architecture to tackle machine
comprehension tasks, such as answering Cloze-style queries with respect to a
document. Unlike previous models, we do not collapse the query into a single
vector, instead we deploy an iterative alternating attention mechanism that
allows a fine-grained exploration of both the query and the document. Our model
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in standard machine comprehension
benchmarks such as CNN news articles and the Children's Book Test (CBT)
dataset.
