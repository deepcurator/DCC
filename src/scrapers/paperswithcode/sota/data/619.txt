Determining the intended sense of words in text - word sense disambiguation
(WSD) - is a long standing problem in natural language processing. Recently,
researchers have shown promising results using word vectors extracted from a
neural network language model as features in WSD algorithms. However, a simple
average or concatenation of word vectors for each word in a text loses the
sequential and syntactic information of the text. In this paper, we study WSD
with a sequence learning neural net, LSTM, to better capture the sequential and
syntactic patterns of the text. To alleviate the lack of training data in
all-words WSD, we employ the same LSTM in a semi-supervised label propagation
classifier. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results, especially on verbs.
