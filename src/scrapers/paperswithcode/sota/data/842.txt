Recently, the connectionist temporal classification (CTC) model coupled with
recurrent (RNN) or convolutional neural networks (CNN), made it easier to train
speech recognition systems in an end-to-end fashion. However in real-valued
models, time frame components such as mel-filter-bank energies and the cepstral
coefficients obtained from them, together with their first and second order
derivatives, are processed as individual elements, while a natural alternative
is to process such components as composed entities. We propose to group such
elements in the form of quaternions and to process these quaternions using the
established quaternion algebra. Quaternion numbers and quaternion neural
networks have shown their efficiency to process multidimensional inputs as
entities, to encode internal dependencies, and to solve many tasks with less
learning parameters than real-valued models. This paper proposes to integrate
multiple feature views in quaternion-valued convolutional neural network
(QCNN), to be used for sequence-to-sequence mapping with the CTC model.
Promising results are reported using simple QCNNs in phoneme recognition
experiments with the TIMIT corpus. More precisely, QCNNs obtain a lower phoneme
error rate (PER) with less learning parameters than a competing model based on
real-valued CNNs.
