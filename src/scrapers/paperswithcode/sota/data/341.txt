Classifying facial expressions into different categories requires capturing
regional distortions of facial landmarks. We believe that second-order
statistics such as covariance is better able to capture such distortions in
regional facial fea- tures. In this work, we explore the benefits of using a
man- ifold network structure for covariance pooling to improve facial
expression recognition. In particular, we first employ such kind of manifold
networks in conjunction with tradi- tional convolutional networks for spatial
pooling within in- dividual image feature maps in an end-to-end deep learning
manner. By doing so, we are able to achieve a recognition accuracy of 58.14% on
the validation set of Static Facial Expressions in the Wild (SFEW 2.0) and
87.0% on the vali- dation set of Real-World Affective Faces (RAF) Database.
Both of these results are the best results we are aware of. Besides, we
leverage covariance pooling to capture the tem- poral evolution of per-frame
features for video-based facial expression recognition. Our reported results
demonstrate the advantage of pooling image-set features temporally by stacking
the designed manifold network of covariance pool-ing on top of convolutional
network layers.
