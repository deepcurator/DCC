The dominant approach for many NLP tasks are recurrent neural networks, in
particular LSTMs, and convolutional neural networks. However, these
architectures are rather shallow in comparison to the deep convolutional
networks which have pushed the state-of-the-art in computer vision. We present
a new architecture (VDCNN) for text processing which operates directly at the
character level and uses only small convolutions and pooling operations. We are
able to show that the performance of this model increases with depth: using up
to 29 convolutional layers, we report improvements over the state-of-the-art on
several public text classification tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first time that very deep convolutional nets have been applied to text
processing.
