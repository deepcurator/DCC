The objective of this paper is to learn a compact representation of image
sets for template-based face recognition. We make the following contributions:
first, we propose a network architecture which aggregates and embeds the face
descriptors produced by deep convolutional neural networks into a compact
fixed-length representation. This compact representation requires minimal
memory storage and enables efficient similarity computation. Second, we propose
a novel GhostVLAD layer that includes {\em ghost clusters}, that do not
contribute to the aggregation. We show that a quality weighting on the input
faces emerges automatically such that informative images contribute more than
those with low quality, and that the ghost clusters enhance the network's
ability to deal with poor quality images. Third, we explore how input feature
dimension, number of clusters and different training techniques affect the
recognition performance. Given this analysis, we train a network that far
exceeds the state-of-the-art on the IJB-B face recognition dataset. This is
currently one of the most challenging public benchmarks, and we surpass the
state-of-the-art on both the identification and verification protocols.
