Despite significant progress of deep learning in the field of computer
vision, there has not been a software library that covers these methods in a
unifying manner. We introduce ChainerCV, a software library that is intended to
fill this gap. ChainerCV supports numerous neural network models as well as
software components needed to conduct research in computer vision. These
implementations emphasize simplicity, flexibility and good software engineering
practices. The library is designed to perform on par with the results reported
in published papers and its tools can be used as a baseline for future research
in computer vision. Our implementation includes sophisticated models like
Faster R-CNN and SSD, and covers tasks such as object detection and semantic
segmentation.
