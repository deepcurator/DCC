A field that has directly benefited from the recent advances in deep learning
is Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). Despite the great achievements of the
past decades, however, a natural and robust human-machine speech interaction
still appears to be out of reach, especially in challenging environments
characterized by significant noise and reverberation. To improve robustness,
modern speech recognizers often employ acoustic models based on Recurrent
Neural Networks (RNNs), that are naturally able to exploit large time contexts
and long-term speech modulations. It is thus of great interest to continue the
study of proper techniques for improving the effectiveness of RNNs in
processing speech signals.
In this paper, we revise one of the most popular RNN models, namely Gated
Recurrent Units (GRUs), and propose a simplified architecture that turned out
to be very effective for ASR. The contribution of this work is two-fold: First,
we analyze the role played by the reset gate, showing that a significant
redundancy with the update gate occurs. As a result, we propose to remove the
former from the GRU design, leading to a more efficient and compact single-gate
model. Second, we propose to replace hyperbolic tangent with ReLU activations.
This variation couples well with batch normalization and could help the model
learn long-term dependencies without numerical issues.
Results show that the proposed architecture, called Light GRU (Li-GRU), not
only reduces the per-epoch training time by more than 30% over a standard GRU,
but also consistently improves the recognition accuracy across different tasks,
input features, noisy conditions, as well as across different ASR paradigms,
ranging from standard DNN-HMM speech recognizers to end-to-end CTC models.
