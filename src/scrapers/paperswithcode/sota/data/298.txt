Although tremendous strides have been made in face detection, one of the
remaining open challenges is to achieve real-time speed on the CPU as well as
maintain high performance, since effective models for face detection tend to be
computationally prohibitive. To address this challenge, we propose a novel face
detector, named FaceBoxes, with superior performance on both speed and
accuracy. Specifically, our method has a lightweight yet powerful network
structure that consists of the Rapidly Digested Convolutional Layers (RDCL) and
the Multiple Scale Convolutional Layers (MSCL). The RDCL is designed to enable
FaceBoxes to achieve real-time speed on the CPU. The MSCL aims at enriching the
receptive fields and discretizing anchors over different layers to handle faces
of various scales. Besides, we propose a new anchor densification strategy to
make different types of anchors have the same density on the image, which
significantly improves the recall rate of small faces. As a consequence, the
proposed detector runs at 20 FPS on a single CPU core and 125 FPS using a GPU
for VGA-resolution images. Moreover, the speed of FaceBoxes is invariant to the
number of faces. We comprehensively evaluate this method and present
state-of-the-art detection performance on several face detection benchmark
datasets, including the AFW, PASCAL face, and FDDB. Code is available at
