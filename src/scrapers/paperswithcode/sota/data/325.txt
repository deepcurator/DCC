One of the main challenges in feature learning using Deep Convolutional
Neural Networks (DCNNs) for large-scale face recognition is the design of
appropriate loss functions that enhance discriminative power. Centre loss
penalises the distance between the deep features and their corresponding class
centres in the Euclidean space to achieve intra-class compactness. SphereFace
assumes that the linear transformation matrix in the last fully connected layer
can be used as a representation of the class centres in an angular space and
penalises the angles between the deep features and their corresponding weights
in a multiplicative way. Recently, a popular line of research is to incorporate
margins in well-established loss functions in order to maximise face class
separability. In this paper, we propose an Additive Angular Margin Loss
(ArcFace) to obtain highly discriminative features for face recognition. The
proposed ArcFace has a clear geometric interpretation due to the exact
correspondence to the geodesic distance on the hypersphere. We present arguably
the most extensive experimental evaluation of all the recent state-of-the-art
face recognition methods on over 10 face recognition benchmarks including a new
large-scale image database with trillion level of pairs and a large-scale video
dataset. We show that ArcFace consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art and
can be easily implemented with negligible computational overhead. We release
all refined training data, training codes, pre-trained models and training
logs, which will help reproduce the results in this paper.
