Commonsense reasoning is a long-standing challenge for deep learning. For
example, it is difficult to use neural networks to tackle the Winograd Schema
dataset~\cite{levesque2011winograd}. In this paper, we present a simple method
for commonsense reasoning with neural networks, using unsupervised learning.
Key to our method is the use of language models, trained on a massive amount of
unlabled data, to score multiple choice questions posed by commonsense
reasoning tests. On both Pronoun Disambiguation and Winograd Schema challenges,
our models outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin,
without using expensive annotated knowledge bases or hand-engineered features.
We train an array of large RNN language models that operate at word or
character level on LM-1-Billion, CommonCrawl, SQuAD, Gutenberg Books, and a
customized corpus for this task and show that diversity of training data plays
an important role in test performance. Further analysis also shows that our
system successfully discovers important features of the context that decide the
correct answer, indicating a good grasp of commonsense knowledge.
