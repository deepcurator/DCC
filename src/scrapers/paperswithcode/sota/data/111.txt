Semantic segmentation requires both rich spatial information and sizeable
receptive field. However, modern approaches usually compromise spatial
resolution to achieve real-time inference speed, which leads to poor
performance. In this paper, we address this dilemma with a novel Bilateral
Segmentation Network (BiSeNet). We first design a Spatial Path with a small
stride to preserve the spatial information and generate high-resolution
features. Meanwhile, a Context Path with a fast downsampling strategy is
employed to obtain sufficient receptive field. On top of the two paths, we
introduce a new Feature Fusion Module to combine features efficiently. The
proposed architecture makes a right balance between the speed and segmentation
performance on Cityscapes, CamVid, and COCO-Stuff datasets. Specifically, for a
2048x1024 input, we achieve 68.4% Mean IOU on the Cityscapes test dataset with
speed of 105 FPS on one NVIDIA Titan XP card, which is significantly faster
than the existing methods with comparable performance.
