The celebrated Sequence to Sequence learning (Seq2Seq) technique and its
numerous variants achieve excellent performance on many tasks. However, many
machine learning tasks have inputs naturally represented as graphs; existing
Seq2Seq models face a significant challenge in achieving accurate conversion
from graph form to the appropriate sequence. To address this challenge, we
introduce a novel general end-to-end graph-to-sequence neural encoder-decoder
model that maps an input graph to a sequence of vectors and uses an
attention-based LSTM method to decode the target sequence from these vectors.
Our method first generates the node and graph embeddings using an improved
graph-based neural network with a novel aggregation strategy to incorporate
edge direction information in the node embeddings. We further introduce an
attention mechanism that aligns node embeddings and the decoding sequence to
better cope with large graphs. Experimental results on bAbI, Shortest Path, and
Natural Language Generation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance and significantly outperforms existing graph
neural networks, Seq2Seq, and Tree2Seq models; using the proposed
bi-directional node embedding aggregation strategy, the model can converge
rapidly to the optimal performance.
