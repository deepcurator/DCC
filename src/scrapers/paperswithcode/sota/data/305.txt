Face detection has achieved great success using the region-based methods. In
this report, we propose a region-based face detector applying deep networks in
a fully convolutional fashion, named Face R-FCN. Based on Region-based Fully
Convolutional Networks (R-FCN), our face detector is more accurate and
computational efficient compared with the previous R-CNN based face detectors.
In our approach, we adopt the fully convolutional Residual Network (ResNet) as
the backbone network. Particularly, We exploit several new techniques including
position-sensitive average pooling, multi-scale training and testing and
on-line hard example mining strategy to improve the detection accuracy. Over
two most popular and challenging face detection benchmarks, FDDB and WIDER
FACE, Face R-FCN achieves superior performance over state-of-the-arts.
