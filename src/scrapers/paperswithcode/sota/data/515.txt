We extend neural Turing machine (NTM) model into a dynamic neural Turing
machine (D-NTM) by introducing a trainable memory addressing scheme. This
addressing scheme maintains for each memory cell two separate vectors, content
and address vectors. This allows the D-NTM to learn a wide variety of
location-based addressing strategies including both linear and nonlinear ones.
We implement the D-NTM with both continuous, differentiable and discrete,
non-differentiable read/write mechanisms. We investigate the mechanisms and
effects of learning to read and write into a memory through experiments on
Facebook bAbI tasks using both a feedforward and GRUcontroller. The D-NTM is
evaluated on a set of Facebook bAbI tasks and shown to outperform NTM and LSTM
baselines. We have done extensive analysis of our model and different
variations of NTM on bAbI task. We also provide further experimental results on
sequential pMNIST, Stanford Natural Language Inference, associative recall and
copy tasks.
