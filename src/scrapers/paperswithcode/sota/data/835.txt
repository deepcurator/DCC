We present a state-of-the-art speech recognition system developed using
end-to-end deep learning. Our architecture is significantly simpler than
traditional speech systems, which rely on laboriously engineered processing
pipelines; these traditional systems also tend to perform poorly when used in
noisy environments. In contrast, our system does not need hand-designed
components to model background noise, reverberation, or speaker variation, but
instead directly learns a function that is robust to such effects. We do not
need a phoneme dictionary, nor even the concept of a "phoneme." Key to our
approach is a well-optimized RNN training system that uses multiple GPUs, as
well as a set of novel data synthesis techniques that allow us to efficiently
obtain a large amount of varied data for training. Our system, called Deep
Speech, outperforms previously published results on the widely studied
Switchboard Hub5'00, achieving 16.0% error on the full test set. Deep Speech
also handles challenging noisy environments better than widely used,
state-of-the-art commercial speech systems.
