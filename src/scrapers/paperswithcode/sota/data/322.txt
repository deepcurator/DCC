In this paper, we present an algorithm for unconstrained face verification
based on deep convolutional features and evaluate it on the newly released
IARPA Janus Benchmark A (IJB-A) dataset. The IJB-A dataset includes real-world
unconstrained faces from 500 subjects with full pose and illumination
variations which are much harder than the traditional Labeled Face in the Wild
(LFW) and Youtube Face (YTF) datasets. The deep convolutional neural network
(DCNN) is trained using the CASIA-WebFace dataset. Extensive experiments on the
IJB-A dataset are provided.
