We introduce the Self-Annotated Reddit Corpus (SARC), a large corpus for
sarcasm research and for training and evaluating systems for sarcasm detection.
The corpus has 1.3 million sarcastic statements -- 10 times more than any
previous dataset -- and many times more instances of non-sarcastic statements,
allowing for learning in both balanced and unbalanced label regimes. Each
statement is furthermore self-annotated -- sarcasm is labeled by the author,
not an independent annotator -- and provided with user, topic, and conversation
context. We evaluate the corpus for accuracy, construct benchmarks for sarcasm
detection, and evaluate baseline methods.
