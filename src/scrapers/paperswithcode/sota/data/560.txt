Most conventional sentence similarity methods only focus on similar parts of
two input sentences, and simply ignore the dissimilar parts, which usually give
us some clues and semantic meanings about the sentences. In this work, we
propose a model to take into account both the similarities and dissimilarities
by decomposing and composing lexical semantics over sentences. The model
represents each word as a vector, and calculates a semantic matching vector for
each word based on all words in the other sentence. Then, each word vector is
decomposed into a similar component and a dissimilar component based on the
semantic matching vector. After this, a two-channel CNN model is employed to
capture features by composing the similar and dissimilar components. Finally, a
similarity score is estimated over the composed feature vectors. Experimental
results show that our model gets the state-of-the-art performance on the answer
sentence selection task, and achieves a comparable result on the paraphrase
identification task.
