Face detection has drawn much attention in recent decades since the seminal
work by Viola and Jones. While many subsequences have improved the work with
more powerful learning algorithms, the feature representation used for face
detection still can't meet the demand for effectively and efficiently handling
faces with large appearance variance in the wild. To solve this bottleneck, we
borrow the concept of channel features to the face detection domain, which
extends the image channel to diverse types like gradient magnitude and oriented
gradient histograms and therefore encodes rich information in a simple form. We
adopt a novel variant called aggregate channel features, make a full
exploration of feature design, and discover a multi-scale version of features
with better performance. To deal with poses of faces in the wild, we propose a
multi-view detection approach featuring score re-ranking and detection
adjustment. Following the learning pipelines in Viola-Jones framework, the
multi-view face detector using aggregate channel features shows competitive
performance against state-of-the-art algorithms on AFW and FDDB testsets, while
runs at 42 FPS on VGA images.
