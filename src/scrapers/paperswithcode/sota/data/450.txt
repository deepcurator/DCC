We present a novel neural network model that learns POS tagging and
graph-based dependency parsing jointly. Our model uses bidirectional LSTMs to
learn feature representations shared for both POS tagging and dependency
parsing tasks, thus handling the feature-engineering problem. Our extensive
experiments, on 19 languages from the Universal Dependencies project, show that
our model outperforms the state-of-the-art neural network-based
Stack-propagation model for joint POS tagging and transition-based dependency
parsing, resulting in a new state of the art. Our code is open-source and
available together with pre-trained models at:
