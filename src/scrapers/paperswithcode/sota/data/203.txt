There has been significant progress on pose estimation and increasing
interests on pose tracking in recent years. At the same time, the overall
algorithm and system complexity increases as well, making the algorithm
analysis and comparison more difficult. This work provides simple and effective
baseline methods. They are helpful for inspiring and evaluating new ideas for
the field. State-of-the-art results are achieved on challenging benchmarks. The
