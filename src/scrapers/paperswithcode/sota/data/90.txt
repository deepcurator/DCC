Semantic Segmentation using deep convolutional neural network pose more
complex challenge for any GPU intensive task. As it has to compute million of
parameters, it results to huge memory consumption. Moreover, extracting finer
features and conducting supervised training tends to increase the complexity.
With the introduction of Fully Convolutional Neural Network, which uses finer
strides and utilizes deconvolutional layers for upsampling, it has been a go to
for any image segmentation task. In this paper, we propose two segmentation
architecture which not only needs one-third the parameters to compute but also
gives better accuracy than the similar architectures. The model weights were
transferred from the popular neural net like VGG19 and VGG16 which were trained
on Imagenet classification data-set. Then we transform all the fully connected
layers to convolutional layers and use dilated convolution for decreasing the
parameters. Lastly, we add finer strides and attach four skip architectures
which are element-wise summed with the deconvolutional layers in steps. We
train and test on different sparse and fine data-sets like Pascal VOC2012,
Pascal-Context and NYUDv2 and show how better our model performs in this tasks.
On the other hand our model has a faster inference time and consumes less
memory for training and testing on NVIDIA Pascal GPUs, making it more efficient
and less memory consuming architecture for pixel-wise segmentation.
