# Embedding Visualization Demo

The code for graph embeddings for individual modalities as well as for the combined triples is [here](../../src/embedding).
The embedding files generated by that code together with metadata are generated in the 'results' folder and can also be found at OSF: [embedding_results.zip](https://osf.io/cnwfz/)
This notebook [EmbeddingDemo.ipynb](EmbeddingDemo.ipynb) demonstrates visualization of supernode embedding results using TSNE (or other low dimensional embedding methods).

## Example output from GAE
The figure below shows the TSNE representation of the supernodes. Colors represent the conferences.
(However, note that these embeddings currently reflect the loss function used for link prediction.)

## Requirements

This demo only requires scikit-learn, pandas, plotly and cufflinks.
