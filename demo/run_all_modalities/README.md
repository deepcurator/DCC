# Deep Code Curator Demo Installation

In this page we provide instructions on the installation of the Deep Code Curator [demo](Deep%20Code%20Curator%20(DCC).ipynb).

## Setup Python Environment

You may use [dcc.yml](../../dcc.yml) to create the Python environment following the below steps:
- Run `conda env create -f dcc.yml` in a **Windows Command** window. The reason we recommend to use Windows Command window is that some versions of Conda Command window has a bug installing 'pip' requirements. If you get the error 'conda not found', add the following lines (or corresponding locations from your computer) into your 'path' system variable: `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3`, `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Local\Continuum\anaconda3\Scripts`.

- Switch to Anaconda Command window and activate the new environment: `activate dcc`
- Add your new environment to Python ipykernel by running the following command `python -m ipykernel install --user --name=dcc`
- Try running jupyter notebook using: `jupyter-notebook`.

- Note: If you run into a "DLL not found" error during the above steps, run the following commands: `pip uninstall pyzmq`, `pip install pyzmq` and then try the step again.

## Install Grobid
[Grobid](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid) is used by the text2graph module to extract text from PDF files.

### Grobid Server
Grobid needs Gradle to be built, and based on our tests we found Gradle 4.10 and Grobid 0.5.5 works smoothly together, and hence we recommend using these versions.

- Install [gradle-4.10](https://gradle.org/next-steps/?version=4.10&format=bin) using the instructions [here](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html)
- Download and extract [grobid-0.5.5](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid/archive/0.5.5.zip)
- cd into grobid-0.5.5, and run the command `gradle clean install`
- At this point, Gradle server is built. Before running the demo, make sure to run `gradle run` in the grobid-0.5.5 folder to start the server. It is successfully started when it stops at 88% to wait for the client requests.

### Grobid Client
Download [Grobid client](https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid-client-python/archive/master.zip) (the whole project as a zip) and extract it to a folder of your choice. You will be specifying its path as an input to the [demo notebook](Deep%20Code%20Curator%20(DCC).ipynb).

## Install Tesseract
[Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) is used by the image2graph module.

For Windows only: Tesseract needs to be installed using the installer from the following link: https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki 
Please make sure that the following line of code is uncommented in the notebook, and has the correct path to the tesseract executable in your local.

```
pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"
```
## Download Other Files
We provide some additional files through the demo folder in the corresponding [OSF project](https://osf.io/jdhw8/). You can click on the "demo" and then download it as a zip to download all required files at once.

### PDFFigures 2.0
[PDFFigures 2.0](https://github.com/allenai/pdffigures2) is used by the image2graph module to extract the images from pdf files. To make its installation more convenient, we provide compiled jar files in the zip named pdffigures.zip. These jar files need to be placed **directly under the dcc\demo\run_all_modalities folder**, without any additional folders e.g. `dcc\demo\run_all_modalities\pdffigures2_2.12-0.1.0.jar`

### Models
Model files for text2graph (text2graph_models.zip) and image2graph (image2graph_models.zip) modules are provided. These zips need to be extracted into seperate folders of your choice, and their paths need to be updated in the corresponding lines from the [demo notebook](Deep%20Code%20Curator%20(DCC).ipynb) as shown below:

```
text2graph_models_dir = "YOUR_PATH_TO_THE_TEXT2GRAPH_MODELS_DIR"
image2graph_models_dir = "YOUR_PATH_TO_THE_IMAGE2GRAPH_MODELS_DIR"
```

### Ontology
Download and place the ontology file named DeepSciKG.nt into a folder of your choice and update its path in the corresponding line (given below) from the [demo notebook](Deep%20Code%20Curator%20(DCC).ipynb) .

```
ontology_file = "YOUR_PATH_TO_THE_ONTOLOGY_DIR\DeepSciKG.nt"
```
